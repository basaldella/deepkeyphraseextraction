Capabilities-Based Query Rewriting in Mediator Systems.
Users today are struggling to integrate a broad range of information
sources providing different levels of query capabilities. Currently, data
sources with different and limited capabilities are accessed either by
writing rich functional wrappers for the more primitive sources, or by
dealing with all sources at a lowest common denominator. This
paper explores a third approach, in which a mediator ensures that sources
receive queries they can handle, while still taking advantage of all of the
query power of the source. We propose an architecture that enables this, and
identify a key component of that architecture, the Capabilities-Based
Rewriter (CBR). The CBR takes as input a description of the capabilities of
a data source, and a query targeted for that data source. From these, the
CBR determines component queries to be sent to the sources, commensurate
with their abilities, and computes a plan for combining their results using
joins, unions, selections, and projections. We provide a language to
describe the query capability of data sources and a plan generation
algorithm. Our description language and plan generation algorithm are schema
independent and handle SPJ queries. We also extend CBR with a cost-based
optimizer. The net effect is that we prune without losing completeness.
Finally we compare the implementation of a CBR for the Garlic project with
the algorithms proposed in this paper.
