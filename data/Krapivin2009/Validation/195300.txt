Using specialized procedures and specification-based analysis to reduce the runtime costs of modularity.
Managing tradeoffs between program structure and program efficiency is one of the most difficult problems facing software engineers. Decomposing programs into abstractions simplifies the construction and maintenance of software and results in fewer errors. However, the introduction of these abstractions often introduces significant inefficiencies.This paper describes a strategy for eliminating many of these inefficiencies. It is based upon providing alternative implementations of the same abstraction, and using information contained in formal specifications to allow a compiler to choose the appropriate one. The strategy has been implemented in a prototype compiler that incorporates theorem proving technology.
