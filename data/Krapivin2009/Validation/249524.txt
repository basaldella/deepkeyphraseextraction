On Runtime Parallel Scheduling for Processor Load Balancing.
AbstractParallel scheduling is a new approach for load balancing. In parallel scheduling, all processors cooperate to schedule work. Parallel scheduling is able to accurately balance the load by using global load information at compile-time or runtime. It provides high-quality load balancing. This paper presents an overview of the parallel scheduling technique. Scheduling algorithms for tree, hypercube, and mesh networks are presented. These algorithms can fully balance the load and maximize locality at runtime. Communication costs are significantly reduced compared to other existing algorithms.
