Approximation Algorithms for the Feedback Vertex Set Problem with Applications to Constraint Satisfaction and Bayesian Inference.
A feedback vertex set of an undirected graph is a subset of vertices that intersects with the vertex set of each cycle in the graph. Given an undirected graph G with n vertices and weights on its vertices, polynomial-time algorithms are provided for approximating the problem of finding a feedback vertex set of G with smallest weight. When the weights of all vertices in G are equal, the performance ratio attained by these algorithms is 4-(2/n). This improves a previous algorithm which achieved an approximation factor of $O(\sqrt{\log n})$ for this case. For general vertex weights, the performance ratio becomes $\min\{2\Delta^2, 4 \log_2 n\}$ where $\Delta$ denotes the maximum degree in G. For the special case of planar graphs this ratio is reduced to 10. An interesting special case of weighted graphs where a performance ratio of 4-(2/n) is achieved is the one where a prescribed subset of the vertices, so-called blackout vertices, is not allowed to participate in any feedback vertex set.It is shown how these algorithms can improve the search performance for constraint satisfaction problems. An application in the area of Bayesian inference of graphs with blackout vertices is also presented.
