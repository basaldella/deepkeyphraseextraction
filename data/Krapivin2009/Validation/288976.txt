Directions of Motion Fields are Hardly Ever Ambiguous.
If instead of the full motion field, we consider only the direction
of the motion field due to a rigid motion, what can we say about the
three-dimensional motion information contained in it? This paper provides a
geometric analysis of this question based solely on the constraint that the
depth of the surfaces in view is positive. The motivation behind this
analysis is to provide a theoretical foundation for image constraints
employing only the sign of flow in various directions and justify their
utilization for addressing 3D dynamic vision problems.It is shown that, considering as the imaging surface the whole sphere,
independently of the scene in view, two different rigid motions cannot give
rise to the same directional motion field. If we restrict the image to half
of a sphere (or an infinitely large image plane) two different rigid motions
with instantaneous translational and rotational velocities(t_1
cannot give rise to the same
directional motion field unless the plane through t_1 and
t_2 is perpendicular to the plane through
_1 and _2 (i.e., (t_1
t_2)  (_1
In addition, in order to give practical
significance to these uniqueness results for the case of a limited field of
view, we also characterize the locations on the image where the motion
vectors due to the different motions must have different directions.If (_1  _2)
(t_1  t_2) &equals; 0 and certain
additional constraints are met, then the two rigid motions could produce
motion fields with the same direction. For this to happen the depth of each
corresponding surface has to be within a certain range, defined by a second
and a third order surface. Similar more restrictive constraints are obtained
for the case of multiple motions. Consequently, directions of motion fields
are hardly ever ambiguous. A byproduct of the analysis is that full motion
fields are never ambiguous with a half sphere as the imaging surface.
