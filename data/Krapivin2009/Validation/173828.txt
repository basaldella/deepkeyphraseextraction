A New Theory of Deadlock-Free Adaptive Routing in Wormhole Networks.
The theoretical background for the design of deadlock-free adaptive routing algorithmsfor wormhole networks is developed. The author proposes some basic definitions and twotheorems. These create the conditions to verify that an adaptive algorithm isdeadlock-free, even when there are cycles in the channel dependency graph. Two designmethodologies are also proposed. The first supplies algorithms with a high degree offreedom, without increasing the number of physical channels. The second methodology isintended for the design of fault-tolerant algorithms. Some examples are given to show theapplication of the methodologies. Simulations show the performance improvement thatcan be achieved by designing the routing algorithms with the new theory.
