A Parallel Algorithm to Reconstruct Bounding Surfaces in 3D Images.
The growing size of 3D digital images causes
sequential algorithms to be less and less usable on whole images and a
parallelization of these algorithm is often required. We have developed an
algorithm named Sewing Faces which synthesizes both geometrical and
topological information on bounding surface of 6-connected3D
objects. We call such combined information a skin. In
this paper we present a parallelization of Sewing Faces. It is based on a
splitting of 3D images into several sub-blocks. When all the
sub-blocks are processed a gluing step consists of merging all the
sub-skins to get the final skin. Moreover we propose a fine-grain approach
where each sub-block is processed by several parallel processors.
