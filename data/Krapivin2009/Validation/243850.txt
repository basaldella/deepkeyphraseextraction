A persistent rescheduled-page cache for low overhead object code compatibility in VLIW architectures.
Object-code compatibility between processor generations is an open issue for VLIW architectures. A potential solution is a technique termed dynamic rescheduling, which performs run-time software rescheduling at the first-time page faults. The time required for rescheduling the pages constitutes a large portion of the overhead of this method. A disk caching scheme that uses a persistent rescheduled-page cache (PRC) is presented. The scheme reduces the overhead associated with dynamic rescheduling by saving rescheduled pages on disk, across program executions. Operating system support is required for dynamic rescheduling and management of the PRC. The implementation details for the PRC are discussed. Results of simulations used to gauge the effectiveness of PRC indicate that: the PRC is effective in reducing the overhead of dynamic rescheduling; and due to different overhead requirements of programs, a split PRC organization performs better than a unified PRC. The unified PRC was studied for two different page replacement policies: LRU and overhead-based replacement. It was found that with LRU replacement, all the programs consistently perform better with increasing PRC sizes, but the high-overhead programs take a consistent performance hit compared to the low-overhead programs. With overhead-based replacement, the performance of high-overhead programs improves substantially, while the low-overhead programs perform only slightly worse than in the case of the LRU replacement.
