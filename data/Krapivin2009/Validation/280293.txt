Intelligent Adaptive Information Agents.
Adaptation in open, multi-agent information gathering systems is
important for several reasons. These reasons include the inability to
accurately predict future problem-solving workloads, future changes in
existing information requests, future failures and additions of agents and
data supply resources, and other future task environment characteristic
changes that require system reorganization. We have developed a multi-agent
distributed system infrastructure, RETSINA (REusable Task Structure-based
Intelligent Network Agents) that handles adaptation in an open Internet
environment. Adaptation occurs both at the individual agent level as well as
at the overall agent organization level. The RETSINA system has three types
of agents. Interface agents interact with the user
receiving user specifications and delivering results. They acquire, model,
and utilize user preferences to guide system coordination in support of the
users tasks. Task agents help users perform tasks by
formulating problem solving plans and carrying out these plans through
querying and exchanging information with other software agents. Information
agents provide intelligent access to a heterogeneous
collection of information sources. In this paper, we concentrate on the
adaptive architecture of the information agents. We use as the domain of
application WARREN, a multi-agent financial portfolio management system that
we have implemented within the RETSINA framework.
