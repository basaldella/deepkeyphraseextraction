The T-Ruby Design System.
This paper describes the T-Ruby system for designing VLSI circuits,
starting from formal specifications in which they are described in terms of
relational abstractions of their behaviour. The design process involves
correctness-preserving transformations based on proved equivalences between
relations, together with the addition of constraints. A class of
implementable relations is defined. The tool enables such relations to be
simulated or translated into a circuit description in VHDL. The design
process is illustrated by the derivation of a circuit for 2-dimensional
convolution.
