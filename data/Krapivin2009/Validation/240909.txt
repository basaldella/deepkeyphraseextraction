The mean square discrepancy of randomized nets.
One popular family of low dicrepancy sets is the (t, m, s)-nets. Recently a randomization of these nets that preserves their net property has been introduced. In this article a formula for the mean square L2-discrepancy of (0, m, s)-nets in base b is derived. This formula has a computational complexity of only O(s log(N) + s2) for large N or s, where bm is the number of points. Moreover, the root mean square L2-discrepancy of (0, m, s)-nets is show to be O(N-1[log(N)](s-1)/2) as N tends to infinity, the same asymptotic order as the known lower bound for  the  L2-discrepancy of an arbitrary set.
