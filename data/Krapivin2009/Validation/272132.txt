The Static Parallelization of Loops and Recursions.
We demonstrate approaches to the static parallelization of loops and
recursions on the example of the polynomial product. Phrased as a loop nest,
the polynomial product can be parallelized automatically by applying a
space-time mapping technique based on linear algebra and linear programming.
One can choose a parallel program that is optimal with respect to some
objective function like the number of execution steps, processors, channels,
etc. However,at best,linear execution time complexity can be atained.
Through phrasing the polynomial product as a divide-and-conquer recursion,
one can obtain a parallel program with sublinear execution time. In this
case, the target program is not derived by an automatic search but given as
a program skeleton, which can be deduced by a sequence of equational program
transformations. We discuss the use of such skeletons, compare and assess
the models in which loops and divide-and-conquer resursions are parallelized
and comment on the performance properties of the resulting parallel implementations.
