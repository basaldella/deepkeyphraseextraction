Pruning Algorithms for Rule Learning.
Pre-pruning and Post-pruning are two standard techniques for handling
noise in decision tree learning. Pre-pruning deals with noise during
learning, while post-pruning addresses this problem after an
overfitting theory has been learned. We first review several
adaptations of pre- and post-pruning techniques for
separate-and-conquer rule learning algorithms and discuss some
fundamental problems. The primary goal of this paper is to show how
to solve these problems with two new algorithms that combine and
integrate pre- and post-pruning.
