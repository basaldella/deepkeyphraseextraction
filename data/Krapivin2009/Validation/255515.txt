Algorithms for Scheduling Real-Time Tasks with Input Error and End-to-End Deadlines.
AbstractThis paper describes algorithms for scheduling preemptive, imprecise, composite tasks in real-time. Each composite task consists of a chain of component tasks, and each component task is made up of a mandatory part and an optional part. Whenever a component task uses imprecise input, the processing times of its mandatory and optional parts may become larger. The composite tasks are scheduled by a two-level scheduler. At the high level, the composite tasks are scheduled preemptively on one processor, according to an existing algorithm for scheduling simple imprecise tasks. The low-level scheduler then distributes the time budgeted for each composite task across its component tasks so as to minimize the output error of the composite task
