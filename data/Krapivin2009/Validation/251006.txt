On the Accuracy of Meta-learning for Scalable Data Mining.
In this paper, we
describe a general approach to scaling data mining applications that
we have come to call meta-learning. Meta-Learning
refers to a general strategy that seeks to learn how to combine a
number of separate learning processes in an intelligent fashion. We
desire a meta-learning architecture that exhibits two key behaviors.
First, the meta-learning strategy must produce an accurate final
classification system. This means that a meta-learning architecture
must produce a final outcome that is at least as accurate as a
conventional learning algorithm applied to all available data.
Second, it must be fast, relative to an individual sequential learning
algorithm when applied to massive databases of examples, and operate
in a reasonable amount of time. This paper focussed primarily on
issues related to the accuracy and efficacy of meta-learning as a
general strategy. A number of empirical results are presented
demonstrating that meta-learning is technically feasible in wide-area,
network computing environments.
