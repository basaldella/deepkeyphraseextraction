Research Demonstration of a Hardware Reference-Counting Heap.
A hardware self-managing heap memory (RCM)
for languages like Lisp, Smalltalk, and Java
has been designed, built, tested and benchmarked.
On every pointer write from the processor, reference-counting
transactions are performed in real time within this memory, and
garbage cells are reused without processor cycles.
A processor allocates new nodes simply by reading from a distinguished
location in its address space. The memory hardware also incorporates
support for off-line, multiprocessing, mark-sweep garbage collection.Performance statistics are presented from a partial
implementation of Scheme over five different memory
models and two garbage collection
strategies, from main memory (no access to RCM) to a fully
operational RCM installed on an external bus.
The performance of the RCM memory is more than
competitive with main memory.
