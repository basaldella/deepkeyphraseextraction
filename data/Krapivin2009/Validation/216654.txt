Language constructs and transformation for hard real-time systems.
In practice, time critical portions of hard real-time systems are still implemented in low-level programming languages and manually tuned to meet all the timing requirements. Without a real-time language that supports an appropriate way of specifying timing constraints for a generic hard real-time systems, and high precision timing analysis that is transparent to users, the users will ever suffer from the complex coding and analysis, particularly for systems requiring fast turnaround responses.In this paper, we propose novel language constructs that can be added to any imperative programming language so that the extended language provides users a way to specify relative timing constraints between arbitrary operations at instruction-level. The compilation techniques unique to transformation of the proposed language are also presented as a part of CHaRTS, the Compiler for Hard Real-Time Systems, which generates a valid instruction sequence for a target execution model.
