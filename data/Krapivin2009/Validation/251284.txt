Nondegeneracy of Polyhedra and Linear Programs.
This paper deals with nondegeneracy of polyhedra and
linear programming (LP) problems. We allow for the possibility
that the polyhedra and the feasible polyhedra of the LP
problems under consideration be non-pointed.
polyhedron is pointed if it has a vertex.) With respect to a given polyhedron, we consider two notions of
nondegeneracy and then provide several equivalent characterizations
for each of them. With respect to LP problems, we study the
notion of constant cost nondegeneracy first introduced by
Tsuchiya [25] under a different name, namely
dual nondegeneracy. (We do not follow this terminology since
the term dual nondegeneracy is already used to refer to a related
but different type of nondegeneracy.) We show two main results about constant cost nondegeneracy of an LP problem.
The first one shows that constant cost nondegeneracy of an LP
problem is equivalent to the condition that the union of all minimal
faces of the feasible polyhedron be equal to the set of feasible points
satisfying a certain generalized strict complementarity condition.
When the feasible polyhedron of an LP is nondegenerate,
the second result shows
that constant cost nondegeneracy is equivalent to the condition
that the set of feasible points satisfying the generalized
condition be equal to the set of feasible points satisfying
the same complementarity condition strictly.
For the purpose of giving a preview of the paper,
the above results specialized to the context of polyhedra and
LP problems in standard form are described in the introduction.
