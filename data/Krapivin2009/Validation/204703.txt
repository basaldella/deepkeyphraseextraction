When is the Assignment Bound Tight for the Asymmetric Traveling-Salesman Problem?.
We consider the probabilistic relationship between the value of a random asymmetric traveling  salesman problem $ATSP(M)$ and the value of its assignment relaxation $AP(M)$. We assume here  that the costs are given by an $n\times n$ matrix $M$ whose entries are independently and  identically distributed. We focus on the relationship between $Pr(ATSP(M)=AP(M))$ and the  probability $p_n$ that any particular entry is zero. If $np_n\rightarrow \infty$ with $n$  then we prove that $ATSP(M)=AP(M)$ with probability 1-o(1). This is shown to be best possible  in the sense that if $np(n)\rightarrow c$, $c>0$ and constant, then $Pr(ATSP(M)=AP(M))<1-\phi(c)$  for some positive function $\phi$. Finally, if $np_n\rightarrow 0$ then $Pr(ATSP(M)=AP(M))\rightarrow 0$.
