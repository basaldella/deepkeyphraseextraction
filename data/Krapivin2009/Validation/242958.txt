Group Invariance and Convex Matrix Analysis.
Certain interesting classes of functions on a real inner product space are invariant  under an associated group of orthogonal linear transformations.  This invariance can  be made explicit via a simple decomposition.  For example, rotationally invariant  functions on {\bf R}$^2$ are just even functions of the Euclidean norm, and functions on  the Hermitian matrices (with trace inner product) which are invariant under unitary  similarity transformations are just symmetric functions of the eigenvalues.  We  develop a framework for answering geometric and analytic (both classical and  nonsmooth) questions about such a function by answering the corresponding question  for the (much simpler) function appearing in the decomposition.  The aim is to  understand and extend the foundations of eigenvalue optimization, matrix  approximation, and semidefinite programming.
