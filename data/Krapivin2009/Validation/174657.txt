The elusive atomic register.
We present a construction of a single-writer, multiple-reader atomic register from single-writer, single-reader atomic registers. The complexity of our construction is asymptotically optimal; O(M2 shared single-writer, single-reader safe bits are required to construct a single-writer, M-reader, N-bit atomic register.
