Solution Differentiability for Nonlinear Parametric Control Problems.
Perturbed nonlinear control problems with data depending  on a vector parameter are considered. Using second-order sufficient  optimality conditions, it is shown that the optimal solution and the adjoint  multipliers are differentiable functions of the parameter.  The proof  exploits the close connections between solutions of a Riccati differential  equation and shooting methods for solving the associated boundary value  problem.  Solution differentiability provides a firm theoretical basis for  numerical feedback schemes that have been developed for computing  neighbouring extremals.  The results are illustrated by an example that  admits two extremal solutions. Second-order sufficient conditions single out  one optimal solution for which a sensitivity analysis is carried out.
