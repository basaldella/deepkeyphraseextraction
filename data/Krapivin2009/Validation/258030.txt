Image Processing with Complex Daubechies Wavelets.
Analyses based on Symmetric Daubechies Wavelets (SDW) lead to
complex-valued multiresolution representations of real signals.
After a recall of the construction of the SDW, we present some
specific properties of these new types of Daubechies wavelets. We
then discuss two applications in image processing: enhancement and
restoration. In both cases, the efficiency of this multiscale
representation relies on the information encoded in the phase of the
complex wavelet coefficients.
