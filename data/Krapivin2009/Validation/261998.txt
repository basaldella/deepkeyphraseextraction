Practical Algorithms for Selection on Coarse-Grained Parallel Computers.
AbstractIn this paper, we consider the problem of selection on coarse-grained distributed memory parallel computers. We discuss several deterministic and randomized algorithms for parallel selection. We also consider several algorithms for load balancing needed to keep a balanced distribution of data across processors during the execution of the selection algorithms. We have carried out detailed implementations of all the algorithms discussed on the CM-5 and report on the experimental results. The results clearly demonstrate the role of randomization in reducing communication overhead.
