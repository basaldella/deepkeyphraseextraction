Implementing a Probabilistic Clock Synchronization Algorithm.
In this paper we present a new probabilistic clock synchronization
algorithm, its prototype implementation and experimental results. The
algorithm follows the client-server programming paradigm and is designed to
work in a departmental environment with few servers and a number of clients
connected through an arbitrary network topology. At the core of the algorithm is a remote clock reading method that
mitigates the negative effects of message delay uncertainty. The
implementation proves the effectiveness of this approach and corroborates the
theoretical speculations.
