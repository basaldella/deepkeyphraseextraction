A Packaging System for Heterogeneous Execution Environments.
A packaging system that allows diverse software components to be easily interconnected within heterogeneous programming environments is described. Interface software and stubs are generated for programmers automatically once the programmers express their application's geometry in a few simple rules and module interconnection language attributes. By generating custom interface code for each application, based on analysis and extraction of interfacing requirements, the system is able to produce executables whose run-time performance is comparable to manually integrated applications. The system is implemented within the Unix environment.
