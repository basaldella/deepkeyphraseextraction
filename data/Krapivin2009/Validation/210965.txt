Approximating the Minimum Equivalent Digraph.
The MEG (minimum equivalent graph) problem is the following: "Given a directed graph,  find a smallest subset of the edges that maintains all reachability relations between nodes." This problem is NP-hard; this paper gives an approximation algorithm achieving a performance guarantee of about 1.64 in polynomial time. The algorithm achieves a performance guarantee of 1.75 in the time required for transitive closure.  The heart of the MEG problem  is the minimum SCSS (strongly connected spanning subgraph) problem --- the MEG problem restricted to strongly connected digraphs. For the minimum SCSS problem,  the paper gives a practical, nearly linear-time implementation achieving a performance guarantee of 1.75.  The algorithm and its analysis  are based on the simple idea of contracting long cycles. The analysis applies directly to $2$-\Exchange,  a general "local improvement" algorithm, showing that its performance guarantee is 1.75.
