Mixed-Mode BIST Using Embedded Processors.
In complex systems, embedded processors may be used to
run software routines for test pattern generation and response
evaluation. For system components which are not completely
random pattern testable, the test programs have to generate
deterministic patterns after random testing. Usually the random
test part of the program requires long run times whereas the
part for deterministic testing has high memory requirements.In this paper it is shown that an appropriate selection of the
random pattern test method can significantly reduce the memory
requirements of the deterministic part. A new, highly efficient
scheme for software-based random pattern testing is proposed,
and it is shown how to extend the scheme for deterministic test
pattern generation. The entire test scheme may also be used for
implementing a scan based BIST in hardware.
