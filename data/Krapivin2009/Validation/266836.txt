Resource-sensitive profile-directed data flow analysis for code optimization.
Instruction schedulers employ code motion as a means of instruction reordering to enable scheduling of instructions at points where the resources required for their execution are available. In addition, driven by the profiling data, schedulers take advantage of predication and speculation for aggressive code motion across conditional branches. Optimization algorithms for partial dead code elimination (PDE) and partial redundancy elimination (PRE) employ code sinking and hoisting to enable optimization. However, unlike instruction scheduling, these optimization algorithms are unaware of resource availability and are incapable of exploiting profiling information, speculation, and predication. In this paper we develop data flow algorithms for performing the above optimizations with the following characteristics: (i) opportunities for PRE and PDE enabled by hoisting and sinking are exploited; (ii) hoisting and sinking of a code statement is driven by availability of functional unit resources; (iii) predication and speculation is incorporated to allow aggressive hoisting and sinking; and (iv) path profile information guides predication and speculation to enable optimization.
