On Generalized Hamming Weights for Galois Ring Linear Codes.
The definition of generalized Hamming weights (GHW)
for linear codes over Galois rings is discussed. The properties
of GHW for Galois ring linear codes are stated. Upper and existence
bounds for GHW of ZF_4 linear codes and a lower
bound for GHW of the Kerdock code over Z_4
are derived. GHW of some ZF_4 linear codes are
determined.
