Multiple Experiment Environments for Testing.
Concurrent simulation (CS) has been used successfully as a
replacement for serial simulation. Based on storing differences from
experiments, CS saves storage, speeds up simulation time and allows
excellent internal observation of events. In this paper, we introduce
Multiple Domain Concurrent Simulation (MDCS) which like concurrent
simulation, maintains efficiency by only simulating differences. MDCS also
allows experiments to interact with one another and create new experiments
through the use of domains. These experiments can be traced and observed at
any point, providing insight into the origin and causes of new experiments.
While many experiment scenarios can be created, MDCS uses dynamic spawning
and experiment compression rather than explicit enumeration to ensure that
the number of experiment scenarios does not become exhaustive. MDCS does not
require any pre-analysis or additions to the circuit under test. Providing
this capability in digital logic simulators allows more test cases to be run
in less time. MDCS gives the exact location and causes of every experiment
behavior and can be used to track the signature paths of test patterns for
coverage analysis.We will describe the algorithms for MDCS, discuss the rules for
propagating experiments and describe the concepts of domains for making
dynamic interactions possible. We will report on the effectiveness of MDCS
for attacking an exhaustive simulation problem such as Multiple Stuck-at
Fault simulations for digital logic. Finally, the applicability of MDCS for
more general experimentation of digital logic systems will be discussed.
