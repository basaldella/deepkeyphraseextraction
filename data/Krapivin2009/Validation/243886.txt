Instruction fetch mechanisms for VLIW architectures with compressed encodings.
VLIW architectures use very wide instruction words in conjunction with high bandwidth to the instruction cache to achieve multiple instruction issue. This report uses the TINKER experimental testbed to examine instruction fetch and instruction cache mechanisms for VLIWs. A compressed instruction encoding for VLIWs is defined and a classification scheme for i-fetch hardware for such an encoding is introduced. Several interesting cache and i-fetch organizations are described and evaluated through trace-driven simulations. A new i-fetch mechanism using a silo cache is found to have the best performance.
