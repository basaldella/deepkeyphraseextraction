An Efficient Protocol for Call Setup and Path Migration in IEEE 802.6 Based Personal Communication Networks.
AbstractRecently, DQDB (IEEE 802.6) MAN has been proposed as a component of Personal Communication Networks, in which base stations of wireless infrastructures are connected by a number of DQDBs which in turn are connected via bridges. We propose a protocol for call setup and path migration in a cluster of DQDBs. The protocol uses a link-state-like routing method for path selection and a source-routing-based scheme for path establishment. In addition, we propose a labeling scheme that makes it possible to carry the path information needed by the source routing protocol in a single 53-octet DQDB slot. Without such a labeling scheme, source routing would be inefficient for our purpose.
