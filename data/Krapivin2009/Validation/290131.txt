Efficient Error-Correcting Viterbi Parsing.
AbstractThe problem of Error-Correcting Parsing (ECP) using an insertion-deletion-substitution error model and a Finite State Machine is examined. The Viterbi algorithm can be straightforwardly extended to perform ECP, though the resulting computational complexity can become prohibitive for many applications. We propose three approaches in order to achieve an efficient implementation of Viterbi-like ECP which are compatible with Beam Search acceleration techniques. Language processing and shape recognition experiments which assess the performance of the proposed algorithms are presented.
