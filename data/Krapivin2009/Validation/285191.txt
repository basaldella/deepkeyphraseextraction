Linearly Derived Steiner Triple Systems.
We attach a graph to every Steiner triple system. The
chromatic number of this graph is related to the possibility
of extending the triple system to a quadruple system. For example,
the triple systems with chromatic number one are precisely the
classical systems of points and lines of a projective geometry
over the two-element field, the Hall triple systems have chromatic
number three (and, as is well-known, are extendable) and all
Steiner triple systems whose graph has chromatic number two are
extendable. We also give a configurational characterization of
the Hall triple systems in terms of mitres.
