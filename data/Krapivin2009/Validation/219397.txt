Adaptive Pattern Matching.
Pattern matching is an important operation used in many applications such as functional programming, rewriting, and rule-based expert systems.  By preprocessing the patterns into a DFA-like automaton, we can rapidly select the matching pattern(s) in a single scan of the relevant portions of the input term.  This automaton is typically based on left-to-right traversal of the patterns.  By adapting the traversal order to suit the set of input patterns, it is possible to considerably reduce the space and matching time requirements of the automaton.  The design of such adaptive automata is the focus of this paper. We first formalize the notion of an adaptive traversal. We then present several strategies for synthesizing adaptive traversal orders aimed at reducing space and matching time complexity.  In the worst case, however, the space requirements can be exponential in the size of the patterns. We show this by establishing  an exponential lower bounds on space that is independent of the traversal order used. We then discuss an orthogonal approach to space minimization based on direct construction of optimal dag automata. Finally, our work brings forth the impact of typing in pattern matching. In particular, we show that several important problems (e.g., lazy pattern matching in ML) are computationally hard in the presence of type disciplines, whereas they can be solved efficiently in the untyped setting.
