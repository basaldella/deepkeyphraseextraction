Online Learning versus Offline Learning.
We present an off-line variant of the mistake-bound model of
learning. This is an intermediate model between the
on-line learning model (Littlestone, 1988,
Littlestone, 1989) and the
self-directed learning model (Goldman, Rivest
Schapire, 1993, Goldman & Sloan, 1994). Just like in the
other two models, a learner in the off-line model has to learn an
unknown concept from a sequence of elements of the instance space on
which it makes guess and test trials. In all models,
the aim of the learner is to make as few mistakes as possible. The
difference between the models is that, while in the on-line model
only the set of possible elements is known, in the
off-line model the sequence of elements (i.e., the
identity of the elements as well as the order in which they are to be
presented) is known to the learner in advance. On the other hand, the
learner is weaker than the self-directed learner, which is allowed to
choose adaptively the sequence of elements presented to him.We study some of the fundamental properties of the
off-line model. In particular, we compare the number of
mistakes made by the off-line learner on certain concept classes to
those made by the on-line and self-directed learners. We give bounds
on the possible gaps between the various models and show examples
that prove that our bounds are tight.Another contribution of this paper is the extension of the
combinatorial tool of labeled trees to a unified approach that
captures the various mistake bound measures of all the models
discussed. We believe that this tool will prove to be useful for
further study of models of incremental learning.
