A Controlled Experiment to Assess the Benefits of Procedure Argument Type Checking.
Type checking is considered an important mechanism for detecting
programming errors, especially interface errors. This report
describes an experiment to assess the defect-detection capabilities
of static, intermodule type checking. The experiment uses ANSI C
and Kernighan&Ritchie (K&R) C. The relevant difference is
that the ANSI C compiler checks module interfaces (i.e., the
parameter lists calls to external functions), whereas K&R C
does not. The experiment employs a counterbalanced design in which
each of the 40 subjects, most of them CS PhD students, writes two
nontrivial programs that interface with a complex library (Motif).
Each subject writes one program in ANSI C and one in K&R C. The
input to each compiler run is saved and manually analyzed for
defects. Results indicate that delivered ANSI C programs contain
significantly fewer interface defects than delivered K&R C
programs. Furthermore, after subjects have gained some familiarity
with the interface they are using, ANSI C programmers remove
defects faster and are more productive (measured in both delivery
time and functionality implemented).
