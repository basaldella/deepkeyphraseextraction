Breadth-first rollback in spatially explicit simulations.
The efficiency of parallel discrete event simulations that use the optimistic protocol is strongly dependent on the overhead incurred by rollbacks. The paper introduces a novel approach to rollback processing which limits the number of events rolled back as a result of a straggler or antimessage. The method, called breadth-first rollback (BFR), is suitable for spatially explicit problems where the space is discretized and distributed among processes and simulation objects move freely in the space. BFR uses incremental state saving, allowing the recovery of causal relationships between events during rollback. These relationships are then used to determine which events need to be rolled back. The results demonstrate an almost linear speedup-a dramatic improvement over the traditional approach to rollback processing.
