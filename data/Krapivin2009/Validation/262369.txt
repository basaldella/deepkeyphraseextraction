Computing Accumulated Delays in Real-time Systems.
We present a verification algorithm for duration properties of
real-time systems. While simple real-time properties constrain the
total elapsed time between events, duration properties constrain the
accumulated satisfaction time of state predicates. We formalize the
concept of durations by introducing duration measures for timed
automata. A duration measure assigns to each finite run of a timed
automaton a real number the duration of
the run which may be the accumulated satisfaction time of a
state predicate along the run. Given a timed automaton with a
duration measure, an initial and a final state, and an arithmetic
constraint, the duration-bounded reachability problem
asks if there is a run of the automaton from the
initial state to the final state such that the duration of the run
satisfies the constraint. Our main result is an (optimal) PSPACE
decision procedure for the duration-bounded reachability problem.
