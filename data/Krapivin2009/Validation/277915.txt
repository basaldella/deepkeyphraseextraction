Application and evaluation of large deviation techniques for traffic engineering in broadband networks.
Accurate yet simple methods for traffic engineering are important for efficient dimensioning of broadband networks. The goal of this paper is to apply and evaluate large deviation techniques for traffic engineering. In particular, we employ the recently developed theory of effective bandwidths, where the effective bandwidth depends not only on the statistical characteristics of the traffic stream, but also on a link's operating point through two parameters, the space and time parameters, which are computed using the many sources asymptotic. We show that this effective bandwidth definition can accurately quantify resource usage. Furthermore, we estimate and interpret values of the space and time parameters for various mixes of real traffic demonstrating how these values can be used to clarify the effects on the link performance of the time scales of burstiness of the traffic input, of the link parameters (capacity and buffer), and of traffic control mechanisms, such as traffic shaping. Our approach relies on off-line analysis of traffic traces, the granularity of which is determined by the time parameter of the link, and our experiments involve a large set of MPEG-1 compressed video and Internet Wide Area Network (WAN) traces, as well as modeled voice traffic.
