Automatic Determination of an Initial Trust Region in Nonlinear Programming.
This paper presents a simple but efficient way to  find a good initial trust   region  radius (ITRR)  in    trust region  methods    for  nonlinear optimization.  The method consists of monitoring the agreement between the  model  and  the objective  function  along   the steepest descent direction, computed at  the starting point.   Further improvements for the starting    point are also derived  from   the information gleaned during the  initializing phase.  Numerical results  on  a large set of problems  show the impact the initial  trust region radius may have on trust   region methods behavior and   the  usefulness of the proposed strategy.
