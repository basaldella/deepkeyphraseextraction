Learning to Recognize Volcanoes on Venus.
Dramatic improvements in sensor and image acquisition technology
have created a demand for automated tools that can aid in the analysis of
large image databases. We describe the development of JARtool, a trainable
software system that learns to recognize volcanoes in a large data set of
Venusian imagery. A machine learning approach is used because it is much
easier for geologists to identify examples of volcanoes in the imagery than
it is to specify domain knowledge as a set of pixel-level constraints. This
approach can also provide portability to other domains without the need for
explicit reprogramming; the user simply supplies the system with a new set
of training examples. We show how the development of such a system requires
a completely different set of skills than are required for applying machine
learning to toy world domains. This paper discusses important
aspects of the application process not commonly encountered in the
toy world, including obtaining labeled training data, the
difficulties of working with pixel data, and the automatic extraction of
higher-level features.
