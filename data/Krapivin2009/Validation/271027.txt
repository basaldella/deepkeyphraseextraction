An interaction of coherence protocols and memory consistency models in DSM systems.
Coherence protocols and memory consistency models are two improtant issues in hardware coherent shared memory multiprocessors and softare distributed shared memory(DSM) systems. Over the years, many researchers have made extensive study on these two issues repectively. However, the interaction between them has not been studied in the literature. In this paper, we study the coherence protocols and memory consistency models used by hardware and software DSM systems in detail. Based on our analysis, we draw a general definition for memory consistency model, i.e., memory consistency model is the logical sum of the ordering of events in each processor and coherence protocol. We also point that in hardware DSM system the emphasis of memory consistency model is relaxing the restriction of event ordering, while in software DSM system, memory consistency model focuses mainly on relaxing coherence protocol. Taking Lazy Release Consistency(LRC) as an example, we analyze the relationship between coherence protocols and memory consistency models in software DSM systems, and find that whether the advantages of LRC can be exploited or not depends greatly on it's corresponding protocol. We draw the conclusion that the more relaxed consistency model is, the more relaxed coherence protocol needed to support it. This conclusion is very useful when we design a new consistency model. Furthermore, we make some improvements on traditional multiple writer protocol, and as far as we aware, we describe the complex state transition for multiple writer protocol for the first time. In the end, we list the main research directions for memory consistency models in hardware and software DSM systems.
