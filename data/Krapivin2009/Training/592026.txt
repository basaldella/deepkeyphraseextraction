Efficient Specification-Based Component Retrieval.
In this paper we present a mechanism for making
specification-based component retrieval more efficient by limiting the
amount of theorem proving required at query time. This is done by
using a classification scheme to reduce the number of specification
matching proofs that are required to process a query. Components are
classified by assigning features that correspond to necessary
conditions implied by the component specifications. We show how this
method of feature assignment can be used to approximate reusability
relationships between queries and library components. The set of
possible classification features are formally defined, permitting
automation of the classification process. The classification process
itself is made efficient by using a specialized theorem proving tactic
to prove feature implication. The retrieval mechanism was implemented
and evaluated experimentally using a library of list manipulation
components. The results indicate a better response time than existing
formal approaches. The approach provides higher levels of consistency
and automation than informal methods, with comparable retrieval
performance.
