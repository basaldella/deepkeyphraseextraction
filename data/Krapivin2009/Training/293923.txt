Quasi-Invariant Parameterisations and Matching of Curves in Images.
In this paper, we investigate quasi-invariance on a smooth
manifold, and show that there exist quasi-invariant
parameterisations which are not exactly invariant but
approximately invariant under group transformations
and do not require high order derivatives.
The affine quasi-invariant parameterisation is
investigated in more detail and exploited for defining general affine
semi-local invariants from second order derivatives only.
The new invariants are implemented and used for matching curve segments
under general affine motions and extracting symmetry axes of
objects with 3D bilateral symmetry.
