A Stochastic/Perturbation Global Optimization Algorithm for Distance Geometry Problems.
We present a new global optimization approach for solving exactly or
inexactly constrained distance geometry problems. Distance geometry problems
are concerned with determining spatial structures from measurements of
internal distances. They arise in the structural interpretation of nuclear
magnetic resonance data and in the prediction of protein structure. These
problems can be naturally formulated as global optimization problems which
generally are large and difficult. The global optimization method that we
present is related to our previous stochastic/perturbation global
optimization methods for finding minimum energy configurations, but has
several key differences that are important to its success. Our computational
results show that the method readily solves a set of artificial problems
introduced by Mor and Wu that have up to 343 atoms. On a set of
considerably more difficult protein fragment problems introduced by
Hendrickson, the method solves all the problems with up to 377 atoms exactly,
and finds nearly exact solution for all the remaining problems which have up
to 777 atoms. These preliminary results indicate that this approach has very
good promise for helping to solve distance geometry problems.
