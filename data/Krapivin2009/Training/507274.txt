Communication complexity method for measuring nondeterminism in finite automata.
While deterministic finite automata seem to be well understood,
surprisingly many important problems concerning nondeterministic
finite automata (nfa's) remain open. One such problem area is the
study of different measures of nondeterminism in finite automata
and the estimation of the sizes of minimal nondeterministic finite
automata. In this paper the concept of communication complexity is
applied in order to achieve progress in this problem area. The main
results are as follows:(1) Deterministic communication complexity
provides lower bounds on the size of nfa's with bounded
unambiguity. Applying this fact, the proofs of several results
about nfa's with limited ambiguity can be simplified and presented
in a uniform way. (2) There is a family of languages
KONk2 with an exponential size gap
between nfa's with polynomial leaf number/ambiguity and nfa's with
ambiguity k. This partially provides an answer to the open
problem posed by B. Ravikumar and O. Ibarra (1989, SIAM J. Comput.
18, 1263-1282) and H. Leung (1998, SIAM J. Comput. 27, 1073-1082).
