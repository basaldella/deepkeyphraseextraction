Recognizing Design Decisions in Programs.
The authors present a characterization of design decisions that is based on the analysis of programming constructs. The characterization underlies a framework for documenting and manipulating design information to facilitate maintenance and reuse activities. They identify and describe the following categories of design decisions: composition and decomposition; encapsulation and interleaving; generalization and specialization; representation; data and procedures; and function and relation. The authors discuss how to recognize and represent design decisions.
