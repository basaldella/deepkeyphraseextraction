Handling Updates and Crashes in VoD Systems.
Though there have been several recent efforts to develop disk based
video servers, these approaches have all ignored the topic of updates and
disk server crashes. In this paper, we present a priority based
model for building video servers that handle two classes of events: user
events that could include enter, play, pause,
rewind, fast-forward, exit, as well assystem
events such as insert, delete, server-down,server-up
that correspond to uploading new movie blocks onto
the disk(s), eliminating existing blocks from the disk(s), and/or
experiencing a disk server crash. We will present algorithms to handle such
events. Our algorithms are provably correct, and computable in polynomial
time. Furthermore, we guarantee that under certain reasonable conditions,
continuing clients experience jitter free presentations. We further justify
the efficiency of our techniques with a prototype implementation and
experimental results.
