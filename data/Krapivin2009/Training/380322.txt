Efficient Local Search for DAG Scheduling.
AbstractScheduling DAGs to multiprocessors is one of the key issues in high-performance computing. Most realistic scheduling algorithms are heuristic and heuristic algorithms often have room for improvement. The quality of a scheduling algorithm can be effectively improved by a local search. In this paper, we present a fast local search algorithm based on topological ordering. This is a compaction algorithm that can effectively reduce the schedule length produced by any DAG scheduling algorithm. Thus, it can improve the quality of existing DAG scheduling algorithms. This algorithm can quickly determine the optimal search direction. Thus, it is of low complexity and extremely fast.
