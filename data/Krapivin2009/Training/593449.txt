Discovery of Frequent Episodes in Event Sequences.
Sequences of events describing the behavior and actions of users or
systems can be collected in several domains. An episode is a
collection of events that occur relatively close to each other in a
given partial order. We consider the problem of discovering
frequently occurring episodes in a sequence. Once such episodes are
known, one can produce rules for describing or predicting the
behavior of the sequence. We give efficient algorithms for the
discovery of all frequent episodes from a given class of episodes,
and present detailed experimental results. The methods are in use in
telecommunication alarm management.
