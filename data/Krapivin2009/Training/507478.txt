Visual Input for Pen-Based Computers.
The design and implementation of a camera-based, human-computer interface for acquisition of handwriting is presented. The camera focuses on a standard sheet of paper and images a common pen; the trajectory of the tip of the pen is tracked and the contact with the paper is detected. The recovered trajectory is shown to have sufficient spatio-temporal resolution and accuracy to enable handwritten character recognition. More than 100 subjects have used the system and have provided a large and heterogeneous set of examples showing that the system is both convenient and accurate.
