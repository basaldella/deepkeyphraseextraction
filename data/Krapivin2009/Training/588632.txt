Detection of Edges in Spectral Data II. Nonlinear Enhancement.
We discuss a general framework for recovering edges in piecewise smooth functions with finitely many jump discontinuities, where $[f](x):=f(x+)-f(x-) \neq 0$. Our approach is based on two main aspects--- localization using appropriate concentration kernels and separation of scales by nonlinear enhancement. To detect such edges, one employs concentration kernels, $K_\epsilon(\cdot)$, depending on the small scale $\epsilon$. It is shown that odd kernels, properly scaled, and admissible (in the sense of having small $W^{-1,\infty}$-moments of order ${\cal O}(\epsilon)$) satisfy  recovering both the location and amplitudes of all edges. As an example we consider general concentration kernels of the form $K^\sigma_N(t)=\sum\sigma(k/N)\sin kt$ to detect edges from the first $1/\epsilon=N$ spectral modes of piecewise smooth f's. Here we improve in generality and simplicity over our previous study in [A. Gelb and E. Tadmor, Appl. Comput. Harmon. Anal., 7 (1999), pp. 101--135]. Both periodic and nonperiodic spectral projections are considered. We identify, in particular, a new family of exponential factors, $\sigma^{exp}(\cdot)$, with superior localization properties.  The other aspect of our edge detection involves a nonlinear enhancement procedure which is based on separation of scales between the edges, where $K_\epsilon*f(x)\sim [f](x) \neq 0$, and the smooth regions where  examples demonstrate that by coupling concentration kernels with nonlinear enhancement one arrives at effective edge detectors.
