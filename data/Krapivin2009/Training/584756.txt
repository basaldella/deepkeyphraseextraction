Numerical study of quantum resonances in chaotic scattering.
This paper presents numerical evidence that in quantum systems with chaotic classical dynamics, the number of scattering resonances near an energy E scales like h-(D(KE)+1)/2 as h  0. Here, KE denotes the subset of the energy surface bounded for all time under the flow generated by the classical Hamiltonian H and D (KE) denotes its fractal dimension. Since the number of bound states in a quantum system with n degrees of freedom scales like h-n, this suggests that the quantity (D (KE) represents the effective number of degrees of freedom in chaotic scattering problems. The calculations were performed using a recursive refinement technique for estimating the dimension of fractal repellors in classical Hamiltonian scattering, in conjunction with tools from modern quantum chemistry and numerical linear algebra.
