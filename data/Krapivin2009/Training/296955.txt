Rapid Concept Learning for Mobile Robots.
Concept learning in robotics is an extremely challenging problem:
sensory data is often high-dimensional, and noisy due to specularities and
other irregularities. In this paper, we investigate two general strategies
to speed up learning, based on spatial decomposition of the sensory
representation, and simultaneous learning of multiple classes using a shared
structure. We study two concept learning scenarios: a hallway navigation
problem, where the robot has to induce features such as
opening or wall. The second task is recycling,
where the robot has to learn to recognize objects, such as a trash
can. We use a common underlying function approximator in both studies
in the form of a feedforward neural network, with several hundred input
units and multiple output units. Despite the high degree of freedom afforded
by such an approximator, we show the two strategies provide sufficient bias
to achieve rapid learning. We provide detailed experimental studies on an
actual mobile robot called PAVLOV to illustrate the effectiveness of this
approach.
