Excluding Symmetries in Constraint-Based Search.
We introduce a new method, called i>symmetry excluding search (SES), for excluding symmetries in constraint based search. To our knowledge, it is the first declarative method that can be applied to i>arbitrary symmetries. The SES-method is based on the notion of symmetric constraints, which are used in our modification of a general constraint based search algorithm. The method does not influence the search strategy. Furthermore, it can be used with either the full set of symmetries, or a subset of all symmetries.We proof correctness, completeness and symmetry exclusion properties of our method. Then, we show how to apply the SES-method in the special case of geometric symmetries (rotations and reflections) and permutation symmetries. Furthermore, we give results from practical applications.
