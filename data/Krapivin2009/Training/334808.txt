The Martin Boundary of the Young-Fibonacci Lattice.
In this paper we find the Martin boundary for the Young-Fibonacci
lattice YF. Along with the lattice of Young diagrams,
this is the most interesting example of a differential partially
ordered set. The Martin boundary construction provides an
explicit Poisson-type integral representation of non-negative
harmonic functions on YF. The latter are in a canonical
correspondence with a set of traces on the locally semisimple Okada
algebra. The set is known to contain all the indecomposable
traces. Presumably, all of the traces in the set are
indecomposable, though we have no proof of this conjecture. Using
an explicit product formula for Okada characters, we derive
precise regularity conditions under which a sequence of
characters of finite-dimensional Okada algebras converges.
