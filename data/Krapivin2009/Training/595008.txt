A Constraint Programming Framework for Local Search Methods.
We propose in this paper a novel integration of local search
algorithms within a constraint programming framework for combinatorial
optimization problems, in an attempt to gain both the efficiency of local
search methods and the flexibility of constraint programming while
maintaining a clear separation between the constraints of the problem
and the actual search procedure. Each neighborhood exploration is
performed by branch-and-bound search, whose potential pruning capabilities
open the door to more elaborate local moves, which could lead to even better
approximate results. Two illustrations of this framework are provided,
including computational results for the traveling salesman problem with
time windows. These results indicate that it is one order of magnitude
faster than the customary constraint programming approach to local search
and that it is competitive with a specialized local search algorithm.
