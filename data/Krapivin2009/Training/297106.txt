Power balance and apportionment algorithms for the United States Congress.
We measure the performance, in the task of apportioning the Congress of the United States, of an algorithm combining a heuristic-driven (simulated annealing) search with an exact-computation dynamic programming evaluation of the apportionments visited in the search. We compare this with the actual algorithm currently used in the United States to apportion Congress, and with a number of other algorithms that have been proposed. We conclude that on every set of census data in this country's history, the heuristic-driven apportionment provably yields far fairer apportionments than those of any of the other algorithm considered, including the algorithm currently used by the United States for Congressional apportionment.
