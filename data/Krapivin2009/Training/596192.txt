A Constraint Satisfaction Approach to a Circuit Design Problem.
A classical circuit-design problem from Ebers and Moll (1954) features a
system of nine nonlinear equations in nine variables that is very
challenging both for local and global methods. This system was solved
globally using an interval method by Ratschek and Rokne (1993) in the box
[0, 10]^9. Their algorithm had enormous costs (i.e., over 14
months using a network of but they state that
at this time, we know no other method which has been applied to this
circuit design problem and which has led to the same guaranteed result of
locating exactly one solution in this huge domain, completed with a reliable
error estimate. The present paper gives a novel branch-and-prune algorithm
that obtains a unique safe box for the above system within reasonable
computation times. The algorithm combines traditional interval techniques
with an adaptation of discrete constraint-satisfaction techniques to
continuous problems. Of particular interest is the simplicity of the
approach.
