Grain Filters.
Motivated by operators simplifying the topographic map of a function, we study the theoretical properties of two kinds of grain filters. The first category, discovered by L. Vincent, defines grains as connected components of level sets and removes those of small area. This category is composed of two filters, the maxima filter and the minima filter. However, they do not commute. The second kind of filter, introduced by Masnou, works on shapes, which are based on connected components of level sets. This filter has the additional property that it acts in the same manner on upper and lower level sets, that is, it commutes with an inversion of contrast. We discuss the relations of Masnou's filter with other classes of connected operators introduced in the literature. We display some experiments to show the main properties of the filters discussed above and compare them.
