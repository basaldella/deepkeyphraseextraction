Heterogeneous CPU Services Using Differentiated Admission Control.
We present an adaptive rate-controlled scheduler for heterogeneous applications running on general purpose computers. Our scheduler can effectively support diverse application requirements. It employs uniform rate-based sharing. Application heterogeneity is satisfied by partitioning CPU capacity into service classes, each with a different criterion for admission control. As a result, we are able to provide at once guaranteed performance, flexible allocation of rates with excellent scalability and intermediate service classes offering tradeoffs between reserved rate utilization and the strength of guarantees. Our scheduler has been implemented in Solaris 2.5.1. It runs existing applications without modifications. We present experimental results showing the scalability, efficiency, guaranteed performance, and overload performance aspects of our scheduler. We demonstrate the importance of priority inheritance implemented in our scheduler for stable system performance.
