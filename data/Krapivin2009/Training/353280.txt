Merging and Splitting Eigenspace Models.
AbstractWe present new deterministic methods that given two eigenspace modelseach representing a set of $n$-dimensional observationswill: 1) merge the models to yield a representation of the union of the sets and 2) split one model from another to represent the difference between the sets. As this is done, we accurately keep track of the mean. Here, we give a theoretical derivation of the methods, empirical results relating to the efficiency and accuracy of the techniques, and three general applications, including the construction of Gaussian mixture models that are dynamically updateable.
