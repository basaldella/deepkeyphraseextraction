Extending Design Environments to Software Architecture Design.
Designing a complex software system is a
cognitively challenging task; thus, designers need cognitive support to
create good designs. Domain-oriented design environments are
cooperative problem-solving systems that support designers in complex
design tasks. In this paper we present the architecture and facilities
of Argo, a domain-oriented design environment for software architecture.
Argos own architecture is motivated by the desire to achieve reuse and
extensibility of the design environment. It separates domain-neutral
code from domain-oriented code, which is distributed among active design
materials as opposed to being centralized in the design environment.
Argos facilities are motivated by the observed cognitive needs of
designers. These facilities extend previous work in design environments
by enhancing support for reflection-in-action, and
adding new support
for opportunistic design and
comprehension and problem solving.
