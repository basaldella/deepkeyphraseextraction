Block Stationary Methods for Nonsymmetric Cyclically Reduced Systems Arising from Three-Dimensional Elliptic Equations.
We consider a three-dimensional convection-diffusion model problem and examine systems of equations arising from performing one step of cyclic reduction on an equally spaced mesh, discretized using the seven-point operator. We present two ordering strategies and analyze block splittings of the resulting matrices. If the matrices are consistently ordered relative to a given partitioning, Young's analysis for the block Gauss--Seidel and block SOR methods can be applied. We compare partitionings for which this property holds with ones where the matrices do not have Property A yet still give rise to an efficient solution process. Bounds on convergence rates are derived and the work involved in solving the systems is estimated.
