Supporting Content-Based Retrieval in Large Image Database Systems.
In this paper, we investigate approaches to supporting effective and
efficient retrieval of image data based on content. We first
introduce an effective block-oriented image decomposition structure
which can be used to represent image content in
image database systems. We then discuss the
application of this image data model to content-based image retrieval.
Using wavelet transforms to extract image features,
significant content features can be extracted from image data
through decorrelating the data in their pixel format
into frequency domain. Feature vectors of
images can then be constructed. Content-based image retrieval
is performed by comparing the feature vectors of the query image
and the decomposed segments in database images.
Our experimental analysis illustrates that the proposed
block-oriented image representation
offers a novel decomposition structure to be used to
facilitate effective and efficient image retrieval.
