SAT-Based Decision Procedures for Classical Modal Logics.
We present a set of SAT-based decision procedures for various classical modal logics. By SAT based, we mean built on top of a SAT solver. We show how the SAT-based approach allows for a modular implementation for these logics. For some of the logics we deal with, we are not aware of any other implementation. For the others, we define a testing methodology that generalizes the 3CNFi>K methodology by Giunchiglia and Sebastiani. The experimental evaluation shows that our decision procedures perform better than or as well as other state-of-the-art decision procedures.
