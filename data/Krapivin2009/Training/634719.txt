Recurrence equations and their classical orthogonal polynomial solutions.
The classical orthogonal polynomials are given as the polynomial solutions pn(x) of the differential equation (x)y''(x) is a polynomial of at most second degree and (x) is a polynomial of first degree.In this paper a general method to express the coefficients An, Bn and Cn of the recurrence equation in terms of the given polynomials (x) and (x) is used to present an algorithm to determine the classical orthogonal polynomial solutions of any given holonomic three-term recurrence equation, i.e., a homogeneous linear three-term recurrence equation with polynomial coefficients.In a similar way, classical discrete orthogonal polynomial solutions of holonomic three-term recurrence equations can be determined by considering their corresponding difference equation (x)y(x) denote the forward and backward difference operators, respectively, and a similar approach applies to classical q-orthogonal polynomials, being solutions of the q-difference equation denotes the q-difference operator.
