Solving Various Weighted Matching Problems with Constraints.
This paper studies the resolution of (augmented)
weighted matching problems within a constraint programming (CP)
framework. The first contribution of the paper is a set of techniques
that improves substantially the performance of branch-and-bound
algorithms based on constraint propagation and the second contribution
is the introduction of weighted matching as a global constraint
( WeightedMatching), that can be propagated using specialized
incremental algorithms from Operations Research. We first compare
programming techniques that use constraint propagation with specialized
algorithms from Operations Research, such as the Busaker and
Gowen flow algorithm or the Hungarian method. Although CP is
shown not to be competitive with specialized polynomial algorithms
for pure matching problems, the situation is different as
soon as the problems are modified with additional constraints.
Using the previously mentioned set of techniques, a simpler branch-and-bound
algorithm based on constraint propagation can outperform a complex
specialized algorithm. These techniques have been applied with
success to the Traveling Salesman Problems [5], which can be
seen as an augmented matching problem. We also show that an incremental
version of the Hungarian method can be used to propagate a  WeightedMatching
constraint. This is an extension to the weighted case of the
work of Rgin [19], which we show to bring significant
improvements on a timetabling example.
