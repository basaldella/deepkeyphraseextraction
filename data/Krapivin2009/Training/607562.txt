Factored Edge-Valued Binary Decision Diagrams.
Factored Edge-Valued Binary Decision Diagrams form an extension to
Edge-Valued Binary Decision Diagrams. By associating both an additive
and a multiplicative weight with the edges, FEVBDDs can be used to
represent a wider range of functions concisely. As a result, the
computational complexity for certain operations can be significantly
reduced compared to EVBDDs. Additionally, the introduction of
multiplicative edge weights allows us to directly represent the
so-called complement edges which are used in OBDDs, thus providing a
one to one mapping of all OBDDs to FEVBDDs. Applications such as
integer linear programming and logic verification that have been
proposed for EVBDDs also benefit from the extension. We also present
a complete matrix package based on FEVBDDs and apply the package to
the problem of solving the Chapman-Kolmogorov equations.
