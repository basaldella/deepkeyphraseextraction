Realizability models for BLL-like languages.
We give a realizability model of Girard-Scedrov-Scott's Bounded Linear Logic (BLL). This gives a new proof that all numerical functions representable in that system are polytime. Our analysis naturally justifies the design of the BLL syntax and suggests further extensions.
