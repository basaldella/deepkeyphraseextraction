What You Always Wanted to Know about Rigid E-Unification.
This paper solves an open problem posed by a number of researchers: the
construction of a complete calculus for matrix-based methods with rigid
E-unification. The use of rigid E-unification and simultaneous rigid
E-unification for such methods was proposed by Gallier et al., in 1987.
After our proof of the undecidability of simultaneous rigid E-unification in
1995. (Degtyarev and Voronkov, 1996d), it became clear that one should look
for more refined techniques to deal with equality in matrix-based methods.
In this article, we define a complete proof procedure for first-order logic
with equality based on an incomplete but terminating procedure for rigid
E-unification. Our approach is applicable to the connection method and the
tableau method and is illustrated on the tableau method.
