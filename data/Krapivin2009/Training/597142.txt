Tune Retrieval in the Multimedia Library.
Musical scores are traditionally retrieved by title, composer or
subject classification. Just as multimedia computer systems increase
the range of opportunities available for presenting musical
information, so they also offer new ways of posing musically-oriented
queries. This paper shows how scores can be retrieved from a database
on the basis of a few notes sung or hummed into a microphone. The
design of such a facility raises several interesting issues
pertaining to music retrieval. We first describe an interface that
transcribes acoustic input into standard music notation. We then
analyze string matching requirements for ranked retrieval of music
and present the results of an experiment which tests how accurately
people sing well known melodies. The performance of several string
matching criteria are analyzed using two folk song databases.
Finally, we describe a prototype system which has been developed for
retrieval of tunes from acoustic input and evaluate its performance.
