Image Sequence Analysis via Partial Differential Equations.
This article deals with the problem of restoring and
motion segmenting noisy image sequences with a static background.
Usually, motion segmentation and image restoration are considered
separately in image sequence restoration. Moreover, motion
segmentation is often noise sensitive. In this article, the motion
segmentation and the image restoration parts are performed in a
coupled way, allowing the motion segmentation part to positively
influence the restoration part and vice-versa. This is the key of our
approach that allows to deal simultaneously with the problem of
restoration and motion segmentation. To this end, we propose a
theoretically justified optimization problem that permits to take
into account both requirements. The model is theoretically
justified. Existence and unicity are proved in the space of bounded
variations. A suitable numerical scheme based on half quadratic
minimization is then proposed and its convergence and stability
demonstrated. Experimental results obtained on noisy synthetic data
and real images will illustrate the capabilities of this original and
promising approach.
