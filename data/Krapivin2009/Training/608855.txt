Structural Fault Testing of Embedded Cores Using Pipelining.
The purpose of this paper is to develop a global design for
test methodology for testing a core-based system in its entirety. This
is achieved by introducing a bypass mode for each core by
which the data can be transferred from a core input port to the
output port without interfering the core circuitry itself. The
interconnections are thoroughly tested because they are used to
propagate test data (patterns or signatures) in the system. The
system is modeled as a directed weighted graph in which the
accessibility (of the core input and output ports) is solved as a
shortest path problem. Finally, a pipelined test schedule is made to
overlap accessing input ports (to send test patterns) and output
ports (to observe the signatures). The experimental results show
higher fault coverage and shorter test time.
