Token-Templates and Logic Programs for Intelligent Web Search.
We present a general framework for the information
extraction from web pages based on a special wrapper language, called
token-templates. By using token-templates in conjunction
with logic programs we are able to reason about web page contents,
search and collect facts and derive new facts from various web pages.
We give a formal definition for the semantics of logic programs
extended by token-templates and define a general
answer-complete calculus for these extended programs. These methods
and techniques are used to build intelligent mediators and web
information systems.
