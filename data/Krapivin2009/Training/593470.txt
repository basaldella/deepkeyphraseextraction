A Microeconomic View of Data Mining.
We present a rigorous framework, based on optimization,
for evaluating data mining operations such as associations and
clustering, in terms of their utility in decision-making. This
framework leads quickly to some interesting computational
problems related to sensitivity analysis, segmentation and the
theory of games.
