A Sequence-Based Object-Oriented Model for Video Databases.
Structuration, annotation and composition are amidst the most crucial modeling issues that video editing and querying in the context of a database entail. In this paper, we propose a sequence-based, object-oriented data model that addresses them in an unified, yet orthogonal way. Thanks to this orthogonality, the interactions between these three aspects are properly captured, i.e., annotations may be attached to any level of video structuration, and all the composition operators preserve the structurations and annotations of the argument videos. We also propose to query both the structuration and the annotations of videos using an extension of ODMG's OQL which integrates a set of algebraic operators on sequences. The overall proposal is formalized and implemented on top of an object-oriented DBMS.
