The Use of Lemmas in the Model Elimination Procedure.
When the model elimination (ME) procedure was first proposed, the notion
of lemma was put forth as a promising augmentation to the basic complete
proof procedure. Here the lemmas that are used are also discovered by the
procedure in the same proof run. Several implementations of ME now exist, but
only a 1970s implementation explicitly examined this lemma mechanism, with
indifferent results. We report on the successful use of lemmas using the
METEOR implementation of ME. Not only does the lemma device permit METEOR to
obtain proofs not otherwise obtainable by METEOR, or any other ME prover not
using lemmas, but some well-known challenge problems are solved. We discuss
several of these more difficult problems, including two challenge problems
for uniform general-purpose provers, where METEOR was first in obtaining the
proof. The problems are not selected simply to show off the lemma device, but
rather to understand it better. Thus, we choose problems with widely
different characteristics, including one where very few lemmas are created
automatically, the opposite of normal behavior. This selection points out the
potential of, and the problems with, lemma use. The biggest problem normally
is the selection of appropriate lemmas to retain from the large number
generated.
