Adaptive Mesh Refinement Using Wave-Propagation Algorithms for Hyperbolic Systems.
An adaptive mesh refinement algorithm developed for the Euler equations of gas dynamics has been extended to employ high-resolution wave-propagation algorithms in a more general framework.  This allows its use on a variety of new problems, including hyperbolic equations not in conservation form, problems with source terms or capacity functions, and logically rectangular curvilinear grids.  This framework requires a modified approach to maintaining consistency and conservation at grid interfaces, which is described in detail.  The algorithm is implemented in the AMRCLAW package, which is freely available.
