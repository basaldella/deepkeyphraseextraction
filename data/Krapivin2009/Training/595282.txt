A KDD framework to support database audit.
Understanding data semantics from real-life databases is

considered following an audit perspective: it must help experts to

analyse what properties actually hold in the data and support the comparison

with desired properties. This is a typical problem of knowledge discovery in

databases (KDD) and it is specified within the framework of Mannila

and Toivonen where data mining consists in querying theories e.g., the theories

of approximate inclusion dependencies. This formalization enables us to

identify an important subtask to support database audit as well as a generic

algorithm. Next, we consider the DREAM relational database reverse engineering

method and DREAM heuristics are revisited within this new setting.
