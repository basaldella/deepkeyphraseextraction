An Interior-Point Algorithm for Nonconvex Nonlinear Programming.
The paper describes an interior-point algorithm for nonconvex nonlinear
programming which is a direct extension of interior-point methods for linear
and quadratic programming. Major modifications include a merit function and
an altered search direction to ensure that a descent direction for the merit
function is obtained. Preliminary numerical testing indicates that the
method is robust. Further, numerical comparisons with MINOS and
LANCELOT show that the method is efficient, and has the promise of
greatly reducing solution times on at least some classes of models.
