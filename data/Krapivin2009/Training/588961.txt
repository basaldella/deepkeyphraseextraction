A Practical Algorithm for General Large Scale Nonlinear Optimization Problems.
We provide an effective and efficient implementation of a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm for the general large scale nonlinear programming problem. In this algorithm the quadratic programming subproblems are solved by an interior point method that can be prematurely halted by a trust region constraint.  Numerous computational enhancements to improve the numerical performance are presented.  These include a dynamic procedure for adjusting the merit function parameter and procedures for adjusting the trust region radius.  Numerical results and comparisons are presented.
