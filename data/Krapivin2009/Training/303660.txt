The Perfectly Matched Layer in Curvilinear Coordinates.
In 1994 Brenger showed how to construct a perfectly matched absorbing layer for the Maxwell system in rectilinear coordinates.  This layer absorbs waves of any wavelength and any frequency without reflection and thus can be used to artificially terminate the domain of scattering calculations.  In this paper we show how to derive and implement the Brenger layer in curvilinear coordinates (in two space dimensions).  We prove that an infinite layer of this type can be used to solve time harmonic scattering problems.  We also show that the truncated Brenger problem has a solution except at a discrete set of exceptional frequencies (which might be empty).  Finally numerical results show that the curvilinear layer can produce accurate solutions in the time and frequency domain.
