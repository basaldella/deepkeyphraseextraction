Bayesian Methods for Efficient Genetic Programming.
A Bayesian framework for genetic programming (GP) is presented. This is motivated by the observation that genetic programming iteratively searches populations of fitter programs and thus the information gained in the previous generation can be used in the next generation. The Bayesian GP makes use of Bayes theorem to estimate the posterior distribution of programs from their prior distribution and likelihood for the fitness data observed. Offspring programs are then generated by sampling from the posterior distribution by genetic variation operators. We present two GP algorithms derived from the Bayesian GP framework. One is the genetic programming with the adaptive Occam's razor (AOR) designed to evolve parsimonious programs. The other is the genetic programming with incremental data inheritance (IDI) designed to accelerate evolution by active selection of fitness cases. A multiagent learning task is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented methods. In a series of experiments, AOR reduced solution complexity by 20% and IDI doubled evolution speed, both without loss of solution accuracy.
