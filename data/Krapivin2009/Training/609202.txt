Combining Program and Data Specialization.
Program and data specialization have always been studied
separately, although they are both aimed at processing early
computations. Program specialization encodes the result of early
computations into a new program&semi; while data specialization encodes
the result of early computations into data structures.In this paper, we present an extension of the Tempo specializer, which
performs both program and data specialization. We show how these
two strategies can be integrated in a single specializer. This new
kind of specializer provides the programmer with complementary
strategies which widen the scope of specialization. We illustrate the benefits
and limitations of these strategies and their combination
on a variety of programs.
