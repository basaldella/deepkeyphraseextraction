Graph Coloring with Adaptive Evolutionary Algorithms.
This paper presents the results of an experimental
investigation on solving graph coloring problems with Evolutionary
Algorithms (EAs). After testing different algorithm variants we
conclude that the best option is an asexual EA using order-based
representation and an adaptation mechanism that periodically changes
the fitness function during the evolution. This adaptive EA is
general, using no domain specific knowledge, except, of course, from
the decoder (fitness function). We compare this adaptive EA to a
powerful traditional graph coloring technique DSatur and the Grouping
Genetic Algorithm (GGA) on a wide range of problem
instances with different size, topology
and edge density. The results show that the adaptive EA is superior
to the Grouping (GA) and outperforms DSatur on the hardest problem
instances. Furthermore, it scales up better with the problem size
than the other two algorithms and indicates a linear computational
complexity.
