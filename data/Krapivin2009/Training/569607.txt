A Chromatic Symmetric Function in Noncommuting Variables.
Stanley (i>Advances in Math. 111, 1995, 166194) associated with a graph i>G a symmetric function i>XG which reduces to i>G's chromatic polynomial {\cal X}_{G}(n) under a certain specialization of variables. He then proved various theorems generalizing results about {\cal X}_{G}(n), as well as new ones that cannot be interpreted on the level of the chromatic polynomial. Unfortunately, i>XG does not satisfy a Deletion-Contraction Law which makes it difficult to apply the useful technique of induction. We introduce a symmetric function i>YG in noncommuting variables which does have such a law and specializes to i>XG when the variables are allowed to commute. This permits us to further generalize some of Stanley's theorems and prove them in a uniform and straightforward manner. Furthermore, we make some progress on the (3 1)-free Conjecture of Stanley and Stembridge (i>J. Combin Theory (i>A) J. 62, 1993, 261279).
