Nice point sets can have nasty Delaunay triangulations.
We consider the complexity of Delaunay triangulations of sets of point s in $\Real^3$ under certain practical geometric constraints. The \emph{spread} of a set of points is the ratio between the longest and shortest pairwise distances.  We show that in the worst case, the Delaunay triangulation of $n$ points in~$\Real^3$ with spread $\Delta$ has complexity $\Omega(\min\set{\Delta^3, n\Delta, n^2})$ and $O(\min\set{\Delta^4, n^2})$.  For the case our lower bound construction consists of a uniform sample of a smooth convex surface with bounded curvature.  We also construct a family of smooth connected surfaces such that the Delaunay triangulation of any good point sample has near-quadratic complexity.
