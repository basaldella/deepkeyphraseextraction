Binary Clutters, Connectivity, and a Conjecture of Seymour.
A binary clutter is the family of odd circuits of a binary matroid, that is, the family of circuits that intersect with odd cardinality a fixed given subset of elements. Let A denote the 0,1 matrix whose rows are the characteristic vectors of the odd circuits. A binary clutter is ideal if the polyhedron $\{ x \geq {\bf 0}: \; Ax \geq {\bf 1} \}$ is integral. Examples of ideal binary clutters are st-paths, st-cuts, T-joins or T-cuts in graphs, and odd circuits in weakly bipartite graphs. In 1977, Seymour [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 22 (1977), pp. 289--295] conjectured that a binary clutter is ideal if and only if it does not contain ${\cal{L}}_{F_7}$, ${\cal{O}}_{K_5}$, or $b({\cal{O}}_{K_5})$ as a minor. In this paper, we show that  a binary clutter is ideal if it does not contain five specified minors, namely the three above minors plus two others. This generalizes Guenin's characterization of weakly bipartite graphs [J. Combin. Theory Ser., 83 (2001), pp. 112--168], as well as the theorem of Edmonds and Johnson [ Math. Programming, 5 (1973), pp. 88--124] on T-joins and T-cuts.
