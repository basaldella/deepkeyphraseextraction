Second-Order Algorithms for Generalized Finite and Semi-Infinite Min-Max Problems.
We present two second-order algorithms, one for solving a class of finite generalized min-max problems and one for solving semi-infinite generalized min-max problems.  Our algorithms make use of optimality functions based on second-order approximations to the cost function and of corresponding search direction functions.  Under reasonable assumptions we prove that both of these algorithms converge Q-superlinearly, with rate at least 3/2.This paper is a continuation of  [E. Polak, L. Qi, and D. Sun,  Comput. Optim. Appl., 13 (1999), pp. 137--161].
