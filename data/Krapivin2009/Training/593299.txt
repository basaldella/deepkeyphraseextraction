How to Determine the Expressive Power of Constraints.
Some constraint languages are more powerful
than others because they allow us to express a larger collection
of problems. In this paper, we give a precise meaning to this
concept of expressive power for constraints over finite sets
of values. The central result of the paper is that the expressive
power of a given set of constraint types is determined by certain
algebraic properties of the underlying relations. These algebraic
properties can be calculated by solving a particular constraint
satisfaction problem, which we call an indicator problem. We
discuss the connection between expressive power and computational
complexity, and show that indicator problems provide a simple
method to test for tractability.
