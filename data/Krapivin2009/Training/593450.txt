Adaptive Fraud Detection.
One method for detecting fraud is to check for suspicious changes in
user behavior. This paper describes the automatic design of user
profiling methods for the purpose of fraud detection, using a series
of data mining techniques. Specifically, we use a rule-learning
program to uncover indicators of fraudulent behavior from a large
database of customer transactions. Then the indicators are used to
create a set of monitors, which profile legitimate customer behavior
and indicate anomalies. Finally, the outputs of the monitors are used
as features in a system that learns to combine evidence to generate
high-confidence alarms. The system has been applied to the problem of
detecting cellular cloning fraud based on a database of call
records. Experiments indicate that this automatic approach performs
better than hand-crafted methods for detecting fraud. Furthermore,
this approach can adapt to the changing conditions typical of fraud
detection environments.
