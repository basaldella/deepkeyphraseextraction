Retraction Approach to CPS Transform.
We study the continuation passing style (CPS) transform and its
generalization, the computational transform, in which the notion
of computation is generalized from continuation passing to an
arbitrary one. To establish a relation between direct style and
continuation passing style interpretation of sequential
call-by-value programs, we prove the Retraction Theorem which says
that a lambda term can be recovered from its CPS form via a
-definable retraction. The Retraction Theorem is proved in
the logic of computational lambda calculus for the simply typable
terms.
