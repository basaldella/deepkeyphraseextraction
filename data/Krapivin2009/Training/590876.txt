A Neural Network Diagnosis Approach for Analog Circuits.
This paper presents a neural network system for the diagnosis of analog
circuits and shows how the performance of such a
system can be affected by the choice of different
techniques used by its submodules. In particular we discuss the influence
of feature extraction techniques such as
Fourier Transforms, Wavelets and Principal Component
Analysis. The system uses several different power supplies and as many
neural networks in parallel. Two different algorithms that can
be used to combine the candidate sets produced by each network are
also presented. The system is capable of diagnosing multiple
faults even if trained on single ones.
