Bayesian parameter estimation via variational methods.
We consider a logistic regression model with a Gaussian prior
distribution over the parameters. We show that an accurate
variational transformation can be used to obtain a closed form
approximation to the posterior distribution of the parameters
thereby yielding an approximate posterior predictive model. This
approach is readily extended to binary graphical model with
complete observations. For graphical models with incomplete
observations we utilize an additional variational transformation
and again obtain a closed form approximation to the posterior.
Finally, we show that the dual of the regression problem gives a
latent variable density model, the variational formulation of
which leads to exactly solvable EM updates.
