Numerical Schemes for Variational Inequalities Arising in International Asset Pricing.
This paper introduces a

valuation model of international pricing in

the presence of political risk. Shipments between countries are

charged with shipping costs and the country specific production

processes are modelled as diffusion processes. The political risk is

modelled as a continous time jump process that affects the drift of the

returns in the politically unstable countries. The valuation model

gives rise to a singular stochastic control problem that is

analyzed numerically. The fundamental tools come from the theory of

viscosity solutions of the associated HamiltonJacobiBellman equation

which turns out to be a system of integral-differential

Variational

Inequalities with gradient constraints.
