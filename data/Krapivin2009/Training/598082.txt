Subexponential loss rates in a GI/GI/1 queue with applications.
Consider a single server queue with i.i.d. arrival and service

processes, \{A,\ A_n,n\geq 0\} and \{C,\ C_n,n\geq

0\}, respectively, and a finite buffer B. The queue content

process \{Q^B_n,\ n\geq 0\} is recursively defined as

Q^B_{n+1}=\min((Q^B_n+A_{n+1}-C_{n+1})^+,B),

q^+=\max(0,q). When \mathbb{E}(A-C)<0, and

A has a subexponential distribution, we show that the stationary

expected loss rate for this queue

\mathbb{E}(Q^B_n+A_{n+1}-C_{n+1}-B)^+ has the following explicit

asymptotic characterization:

\mathbb{E}(Q^B_n+A_{n+1}-C_{n+1}-B)^+\sim \mathbb{E}(A-B)^+ \quad

\hbox{as} \ B\rightarrow \infty, independently of the server process

C_n. For a fluid queue with capacity c,

M/G/\infty arrival process A_t, characterized by

intermediately regularly varying on periods \tau^{\mathrm{on}},

which arrive with Poisson rate \Lambda, the average loss rate

\lambda_{\mathrm{loss}}^B satisfies

{\lambda_{\mathrm{loss}}^B}\sim \Lambda

\mathbb{E}(\tau^{\mathrm{on}}\eta-B)^+ \quad \hbox{as}\ B\rightarrow

\infty, where \eta=r+\rho-c,


r) is the rate at which the fluid is arriving during an on period.

Accuracy of the above asymptotic relations is verified with extensive numerical

and simulation experiments. These explicit formulas have potential application

in designing communication networks that will carry traffic with

long-tailed characteristics, e.g., Internet data services.
