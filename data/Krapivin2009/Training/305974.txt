Exploiting Discontinuities in Optical Flow.
Most optical flow estimation techniques have substantial difficulties
dealing with flow discontinuities. Methods which simultaneously detect
flow boundaries and use the detected boundaries to aid in flow
estimation can produce significantly improved results. Current
approaches to implementing these methods still have important
limitations, however. We demonstrate three such problems: errors due
to the mixture of image properties across boundaries, an intrinsic
ambiguity in boundary location when only short sequences are
considered, and difficulties insuring that the motion of a boundary
aids in flow estimation for the surface to which it is attached without
corrupting the flow estimates for the occluded surface on the other
side. The first problem can be fixed by basing flow estimation only on
image changes at edges. The second requires an analysis of longer time
intervals. The third can be aided by using a boundary detection
mechanism which classifies the sides of boundaries as occluding and
occluded at the same time as the boundaries are detected.
