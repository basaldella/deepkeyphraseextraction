A New Criterion for Comparing Fuzzy Logics for Uncertain Reasoning.
A new criterion is introduced for judging the suitability of
various fuzzy logics for practical uncertain reasoning in a
probabilistic world and the relationship of this criterion to several
established criteria, and its consequences for truth functional belief,
are investigated.
