Concepts for Resource Reservation in Advance.
Resource management offers Quality-of-Service reliability for
time-critical continuous-media applications. Currently, existing resource
management systems in the Internet and ATM domain only provide means to
reserve resources starting with the reservation attempt and lasting for an
unspecified duration. However, for several applications such as video
conferencing, the ability to reserve the required resources in advance is of
great advantage. This paper outlines a new model for resource reservation in
advance. We identify and discuss issues to be resolved for allowing resource
reservation in advance. We show how the resource reservation in advance
scheme can be embedded in a general architecture and describe the design and
implementation of a resource management system providing reservation in
advance functionality.
