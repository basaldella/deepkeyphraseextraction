Hashing Methods for Temporal Data.
External dynamic hashing has been used in traditional database systems as a fast method for answering membership queries. Given a dynamic set S of objects, a membership query asks whether an object with identity k is in (the most current state of) S. This paper addresses the more general problem of Temporal Hashing. In this setting, changes to the dynamic set are timestamped and the membership query has a temporal predicate, as in: "Find whether object with identity k was in set S at time t. " We present an efficient solution for this problem that takes an ephemeral hashing scheme and makes it partially persistent. Our solution, also termed partially persistent hashing, uses linear space on the total number of changes in the evolution of set S and has a small (O(\log_B(n/B))) query overhead. An experimental comparison of partially persistent hashing with various straightforward approaches (like external linear hashing, the Multiversion B-Tree, and the R*-tree) shows that it provides the faster membership query response time. Partially persistent hashing should be seen as an extension of traditional external dynamic hashing in a temporal environment. It is independent of the ephemeral dynamic hashing scheme used; while the paper concentrates on linear hashing, the methodology applies to other dynamic hashing schemes as well.
