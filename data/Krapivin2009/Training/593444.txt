Mathematical Programming in Data Mining.
Mathematical programming approaches to three fundamental problems
will be described: feature selection, clustering and robust
representation. The feature selection problem considered is that of
discriminating between two sets while recognizing irrelevant and
redundant features and suppressing them. This creates a lean model
that often generalizes better to new unseen data. Computational
results on real data confirm improved generalization of leaner
models. Clustering is exemplified by the unsupervised learning of
patterns and clusters that may exist in a given database and is a
useful tool for knowledge discovery in databases (KDD). A
mathematical programming formulation of this problem is proposed that
is theoretically justifiable and computationally implementable in a
finite number of steps. A resulting k-Median Algorithm is utilized to
discover very useful survival curves for breast cancer patients from
a medical database. Robust representation is concerned with
minimizing trained model degradation when applied to new problems. A
novel approach is proposed that purposely tolerates a small error in
the training process in order to avoid overfitting data that may
contain errors. Examples of applications of these concepts are
given.
