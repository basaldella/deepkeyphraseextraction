A Channel Sharing Scheme for Cellular Mobile Communications.
This paper presents a channel sharing scheme, Neighbor Cell Channel
Sharing (NCCS) , based on region partitioning of cell coverage for wireless
cellular networks. Each cell is divided into an inner-cell region and an
outer-cell region. Cochannel interference is suppressed by limiting the
usage of sharing channels in the inner-cell region. The channel sharing
scheme achieves a traffic-adaptive channel assignment and does not require
any channel locking. Performance analysis shows that using the NCCS scheme
leads to a lower call blocking probability and a better channel utilization
as compared with other previously proposed channel assignment schemes.
