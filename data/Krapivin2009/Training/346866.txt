Analytical comparison of local and end-to-end error recovery in reactive routing protocols for mobile ad hoc networks.
In this paper we investigate the effect of local error recovery vs. end-to-end error recovery in reactive protocols. For this purpose, we analyze and compare the performance of two protocols: the Dynamic Source Routing protocol (DSR[2]), which does end-to-end error recovery when a route fails and the Witness Aided Routing protocol (WAR[1]), which uses local correction mechanisms to recover from route failures. We show that the performance of DSR degrades extremely fast as the route length increases (that is, DSR is not scalable), while WAR maintains both low latency and low resource consumption regardless of the route length.
