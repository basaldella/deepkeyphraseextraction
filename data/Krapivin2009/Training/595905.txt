Contexts in Dynamic Predicate Logic.
In this paper we introduce a notion of context for Groenendijk &
Stokhofs Dynamic Predicate Logic DPL. We use these contexts to
give a characterization of the relations
on assignments that can be generated by composition from tests
and random resettings
in the case that we are working over an infinite domain.
These relations are precisely the ones expressible in
DPL if we allow ourselves arbitrary
tests as a starting point. We discuss some
possible extensions of DPL and the
way these extensions interact with our notion of context.
