Threads Yield Continuations.
Just as a traditional continuation represents the rest of a
computation from a given point in the computation, a subcontinuation
represents the rest of a subcomputation from a
given point in the subcomputation. Subcontinuations
are more expressive than traditional continuations and have been shown to be
useful for controlling tree-structured concurrency, yet they have
previously been implemented only on uniprocessors. This article describes a
concurrent implementation of one-shot subcontinuations. Like one-shot
continuations, one-shot subcontinuations are first-class but may be invoked
at most once, a restriction obeyed by nearly all programs that use
continuations. The techniques used to implement one-shot subcontinuations
may be applied directly to other one-shot continuation mechanisms and may be
generalized to support multi-shot continuations as well. A novel feature of
the implementation is that continuations are implemented in terms of
threads. Because the implementation model does not rely upon any special
language features or compilation techniques, the model is applicable to
any language or language implementation that supports a small set of thread
primitives.
