Simple Bayesian Model for Bitmap Compression.
Bitmaps are a useful, but storage voracious, component of many
information retrieval systems. Earlier efforts to compress bitmaps
were based on models of bit generation, particularly Markov models.
While these permitted considerable reduction in storage, the short
memory of Markov models may limit their compression efficiency. In
this paper we accept the state orientation of Markov models, but
introduce a Bayesian approach to assess the state&semi; the analysis is
based on data accumulating in a growing window. The paper describes
the details of the probabilistic assumptions governing the Bayesian
analysis, as well as the protocol for controlling the window that
receives the data. We find slight improvement over the best
performing strictly Markov models.
