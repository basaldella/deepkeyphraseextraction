Convergence of a Difference Scheme for Conservation Laws with a Discontinuous Flux.
Convergence is established for a scalar finite difference scheme, based on the Godunov or Engquist--Osher (EO) flux, for scalar conservation laws having a flux that is spatially dependent through a possibly discontinuous coefficient. Other works in this direction have established convergence for methods employing the solution of  2  2 Riemann problems. The algorithm discussed here uses only scalar Riemann solvers. Satisfaction of a set of Kruzkov-type entropy inequalities is established for the limit solution, from which geometric entropy conditions follow. Assuming a piecewise constant coefficient, it is shown that these conditions imply L1-contractiveness for piecewise C1 solutions, thus extending a well-known theorem.
