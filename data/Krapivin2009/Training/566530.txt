Optimal deterministic protocols for mobile robots on a grid.
This paper studies a system of m robots operating in a set of n work locations connected by aisles in a nxn grid, where mn.Form time to the robots need to move along the aisles, in order to visit disjoint sets of locations. The movement of the robots must comply with the following constraints: (1) no two robots can collide at a grid node or traverse a grid edge at the same time; (2) a robot's sensory capability is limited to detecting the presence of another robot at a neighboring node. We present a deterministic protocol that, for any small constant e > 0, allows m(1-e)n targets and no target is visited by more than one robot. We also prove a lower bound showing that our protocols were known only for m n, while for general m n only a suboptimal randomized protocols were known.
