Selected Research Issues in Decision Support Databases.
A flurry of buzzwords awaits anyone investigating database
technology for decision support:
data warehouse, multidimensional and dimensional database, on-line analytical
processing, star
schema, slicing, dicing, drill-down and roll-up. We introduce the area via
an example based on a
long-ago project to design a repository on energy information for the US
Department of Energy. Once we
have introduced some terminology, we explore research issues associated with
decision-support
databases, including representation, modeling, metadata, architectures
and query processing. The
purpose of this paper is to provide researchers with the background they
need to contribute to this area.
