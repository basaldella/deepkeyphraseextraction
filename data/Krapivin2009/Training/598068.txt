Window flow control in FIFO networks with cross traffic.
We focus on window flow control as used in packet-switched

communication networks. The approach consists in studying the stability of a

system where each node on the path followed by the packets of the controlled

connection is modeled by a FIFO

queue of infinite capacity which receives in addition some cross traffic

represented by an exogenous flow. Under general stochastic assumptions, namely

for stationary and ergodic input processes, we show the existence of a maximum

throughput allowed by the flow control. Then we establish bounds on the value

of this maximum throughput. These bounds, which do not coincide in general, are

reached by time-space scalings of the exogenous flows. Therefore, the

performance of the window flow control depends not only on the traffic

intensity of the cross flows, but also on fine statistical characteristics such

as the burstiness of these flows. These results are illustrated by several

examples, including the case of a nonmonotone, nonconvex and fractal stability

region.
