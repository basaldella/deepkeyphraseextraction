Progressive Transmission of Vector Map Data over the World Wide Web.
Within distributed computing environments, access to very large geospatial datasets often suffers from slow or unreliable network connections. To allow users to start working with a partially delivered dataset, progressive transmission methods are a viable solution. While incremental and progressive methods have been applied successfully to the transmission of raster images over the World Wide Web, and, in the form of prototypes, of triangular meshes, the transmission of vector map datasets has lacked a similar attention. This paper introduces a solution to the progressive transmission of vector map data that allows users to apply analytical GIS methods to partially transmitted data sets. The architecture follows a client-server model with multiple map representations at the server side, and a thin client that compiles transmitted increments into a topologically consistent format. This paper describes the concepts, develops an architecture, and discusses implementation concerns.
