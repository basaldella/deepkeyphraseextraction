Overcoming the Myopia of Inductive Learning Algorithms with RELIEFF.
Current inductive machine learning algorithms typically use greedy search
with limited lookahead. This prevents them to detect significant conditional
dependencies between the attributes that describe training objects. Instead
of myopic impurity functions and lookahead, we propose to use RELIEFF,
an extension of
RELIEF developed by Kira and Rendell &lsqb;10, 11&rsqb;,
for heuristic guidance of inductive learning
algorithms. We have reimplemented  Assistant, a system for top down induction of decision
trees, using RELIEFF as an estimator of attributes at each selection step.
The algorithm is tested on several artificial and several real world problems and the results
are compared with some other well known machine learning algorithms.
Excellent results on artificial data sets and two real world problems show the advantage
of the presented approach to inductive
learning.
