Mixed-initiative mixed computation.
We show that partial evaluation can be usefully viewed as a programming model for realizing mixed-initiative functionality in interactive applications. Mixed-initiative interaction between two participants is one where the parties can take turns at any time to change and steer the flow of interaction. We concentrate on the facet of mixed-initiative referred to as 'unsolicited reporting' and demonstrate how out-of-turn interactions by users can be modeled by 'jumping ahead' to nested dialogs (via partial evaluation). Our approach permits the view of dialog management systems in terms of their support for staging and simplifying inter-actions; we characterize three different voice-based interaction technologies using this viewpoint. In particular, we show that the built-in form interpretation algorithm (FIA) in the VoiceXML dialog management architecture is actually a (well disguised) combination of an interpreter and a partial evaluator.
