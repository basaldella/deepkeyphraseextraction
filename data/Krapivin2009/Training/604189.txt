A typed interface for garbage collection.
An important consideration for certified code systems is the interaction of the untrusted program with the runtime system, most notably the garbage collector. Most certified code systems that treat the garbage collector as part of the trusted computing base dispense with this issue by using a collector whose interface with the program is simple enough that it does not pose any certification challenges. However, this approach rules out the use of many sophisticated high-performance garbage collectors. We present the language LGC, whose type system is capable of expressing the interface of a modern high-performance garbage collector. We use LGC to describe the interface to one such collector, which involves a substantial amount of programming at the type constructor level of the language.
