The Constraint Language for Lambda Structures.
This paper presents the Constraint Language for Lambda Structures
(CLLS), a first-order language for semantic underspecification that
conservatively extends dominance constraints. It is interpreted over
lambda structures, tree-like structures that encode
-terms. Based on
CLLS, we present an underspecified, uniform analysis of scope,
ellipsis, anaphora, and their interactions. CLLS solves a variable
capturing problem that is omnipresent in scope underspecification and
can be processed efficiently.
