Risk and expectations in a-priori time allocation in multi-agent contracting.
In related research we have proposed a market architecture for multi-agent contracting and we have implemented prototypes of both the market architecture and the agents in a system called MAGNET. A customer agent in MAGNET solicits bids for the execution of multi-step plans, in which tasks have precedence and time constraints, by posting a Request for Quotes to the market. The Request for Quotes needs to include for each task its precedence constraints and a time window. In this paper, we study the problem of optimizing the time windows in the Requests for Quotes. Our approach is to use the Expected Utility Theory to reduce the likelihood of receiving unattractive bids, while maximizing the number of bids that are likely to be included in the winning bundle. We describe the model, illustrate its operation and properties, and discuss what assumptions are required for its successful integration into MAGNET or other multi-agent contracting systems.
