Simple 8-Designs with Small Parameters.
We show the existence of simple 8-(31,10,93) and 8-(31,10,100)
designs. For each value of  we show 3 designs in full
detail. The designs are constructed with a prescribed group of automorphisms
using the method of Kramer and Mesner KramerMesner76.
They are the first 8-designs with small parameters which are known
explicitly. We do not yet know if PSL(3,5) is the full group
of automorphisms of the given designs. There are altogether 138 designs with
designs with
PSL(3,5) as a group of automorphisms. We prove that they are
all pairwise non-isomorphic. For this purpose, a brief account on the
intersection numbers of these designs is given. The proof is done in two
different ways. At first, a quite general group theoretic observation shows
that there are no isomorphisms. In a second approach we use the block
intersection types as invariants, they classify the designs completely.
