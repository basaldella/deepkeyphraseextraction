QoS Management in Educational Digital Library Environments.
Advances in multimedia computing technologies offer new approaches to
the support of computer-assisted education and training within many
application domains. Novel interactive presentation tools can be
built to enhance traditional teaching methods with more active
learning. Since a variety of user expectations are possible in such
an environment, research must address the incorporation of these
factors into presentation tools. During an interactive
learning/training process, presentation tools must be able to handle
various types of delays. A flexibly adjustable quality of service
(QoS) should thus be supported. In this paper, we investigate a
framework and systematic strategies for supporting the continuous and
synchronized retrieval and presentation of multimedia data streams in
a client/server distributed multimedia environment for educational
digital libraries. Specifically, we establish a practical framework
for specifying multimedia objects, tasks, schedules, and
synchronization constraints between media streams. We identify the
QoS parameters critical to the support of multimedia presentations
for learning and training activities. Based on the proposed framework
and QoS specifications, we develop presentation scheduling and buffer
management strategies which can enforce the specified QoS
requirements in an educational digital library environment.
