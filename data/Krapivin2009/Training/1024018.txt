Arithmetic Circuits and Polynomial Replacement Systems.
This paper addresses the problems of counting proof-trees (as introduced by Venkateswaran and Tompa) and counting proof-circuits, a related but seemingly more natural question.  These problems lead to a common generalization of straight-line programs which we call polynomial replacement systems {PRSs}.  We contribute a classification of these systems and we investigate their complexity.  Diverse problems falling within the scope of this study include, for example, counting proof-circuits and evaluating $\{\cup,+\}$-circuits over the natural numbers.  A number of complexity results are obtained, including a proof that counting proof-circuits is $\numP$-complete.
