On Residue Symbols and the Mullineux Conjecture.
This paper is concerned with properties of the Mullineux
map, which plays a rle in p-modular representation theory of
symmetric groups. We introduce the residue symbol for a p-regular
partitions, a variation of the Mullineux symbol, which makes the
detection and removal of good nodes (as introduced by Kleshchev) in
the partition easy to describe. Applications of this idea include a
short proof of the combinatorial conjecture to which the Mullineux
conjecture had been reduced by Kleshchev.
