Clustering for Approximate Similarity Search in High-Dimensional Spaces.
In this paper, we present a clustering and indexing paradigm (called Clindex) for high-dimensional search spaces. The scheme is designed for approximate similarity searches, where one would like to find many of the data points near a target point, but where one can tolerate missing a few near points. For such searches, our scheme can find near points with high recall in very few IOs and perform significantly better than other approaches. Our scheme is based on finding clusters and, then, building a simple but efficient index for them. We analyze the trade-offs involved in clustering and building such an index structure, and present extensive experimental results.
