Learning Structure from Data and Its Application to Ozone Prediction.
In this paper we propose an algorithm for structure learning in
predictive expert systems based on a probabilistic network
representation. The idea is to have the simplest structure
(minimum number of links) with acceptable predictive capability. The
algorithm starts by building a tree structure based on measuring
mutual information between pairs of variables, and then it adds links
as necessary to obtain certain predictive performance. We have
applied this method for ozone prediction in Mxico City, where
the ozone level is used as a global indicator for the air quality in
different parts of the city. It is important to predict the ozone
level a day, or at least several hours in advance, to reduce the
health hazards and industrial losses that occur when the ozone
reaches emergency levels. We obtained as a first approximation a
tree-structured dependency model for predicting ozone in one part of
the city. We observe that even with only three parameters, its
estimations are acceptable.A causal network representation and the structure learning techniques
produced some very interesting results for the ozone prediction
problem. Firstly, we got some insight into the dependence structure
of the phenomena. Secondly, we got an indication of which are the
important and not so important variables for ozone forecasting.
Taking this into account, the measurement and computational costs for
ozone prediction could be reduced. And thirdly, we have obtained
satisfactory short term ozone predictions based on a small set of the
most important parameters.
