An Implementation of Interprocedural Bounded Regular Section Analysis.
Regular section analysis, which summarizes interprocedural side effects on subarrays in a form useful to dependence analysis, while avoiding the complexity of prior solutions, is shown to be a practical addition to a production compiler. Optimizing compilers should produce efficient code even in the presence of high-level language constructs. However, current programming support systems are significantly lacking in their ability to analyze procedure calls. This deficiency complicates parallel programming, because loops withcalls can be a significant source of parallelism. The performance of regular section analysis is compared to two benchmarks: the LINPACK library of linear algebra subroutines and the Rice Compiler Evaluation Program Suite (RiCEPS), a set of complete application codes from a variety of scientific disciplines. The experimental results demonstrate that regular section analysis is an effective means of discovering parallelism, given programs written in an appropriately modular programming style.
