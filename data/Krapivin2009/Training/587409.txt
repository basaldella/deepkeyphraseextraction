Asymptotic Analysis of the Laminar Viscous Flow Over a Porous Bed.
We consider the laminar viscous channel flow over a porous  surface.  The size of the pores is much smaller than the size of  the channel, and it is important to determine the effective  boundary conditions at the porous surface.  We study the  corresponding boundary layers, and,  by a rigorous asymptotic  expansion, we obtain Saffman's modification of the interface condition  observed by Beavers and Joseph. The effective coefficient in the  law is determined through an auxiliary boundary-layer type  problem, whose computational and modeling aspects are discussed in  detail. Furthermore, the approximation errors for the velocity and  for the effective mass flow are given as powers of the  characteristic pore size $\ep$. Finally, we give the interface condition  linking the effective pressure fields in the porous medium and in  the channel, and we determine the jump of the effective pressures  explicitly.
