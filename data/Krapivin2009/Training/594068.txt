Spectral Sequences on Combinatorial Simplicial Complexes.
The goal of this paper is twofold. First, we give an elementary introduction to the usage of spectral sequences in the combinatorial setting. Second we list a number of applications.In the first group of applications the simplicial complex is the nerve of a poset&semi; we consider general posets and lattices, as well as partition-type posets. Our last application is of a different nature: the {\cal S}_n-quotient of the complex of directed forests is a simplicial complex whose cell structure is defined combinatorially.
