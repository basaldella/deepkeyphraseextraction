Implications of Classical Scheduling Results for Real-Time Systems.
Important classical scheduling theory results for real-time computing are identified. Implications of these results from the perspective of a real-time systems designer are discussed. Uni- processor and multiprocessor results are addressed as well as important issues such as future release times, precedence constraints, shared resources, task value, overloads, static versus dynamic scheduling, preemption versus non-preemption, multiprocessing anomalies, and metrics. Examples of what scheduling algorithms are used in actual applications are given.
