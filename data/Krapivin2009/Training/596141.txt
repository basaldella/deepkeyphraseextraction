On the Complexity of Semidefinite Programs.
We show that the feasibility of a system of m linear inequalities over
the cone of symmetric positive semidefinite matrices of order n can
be tested in mn^O(min{m,n^2}) arithmetic operations with
ln^O(min{m,n^2})-bit numbers, where l is the maximum binary
size of the input coefficients. We also show that any feasible system of
dimension (m,n) has a solution X such that log||X||
ln^O(min{m,n^2}).
