Matching Index Expressions for Information Retrieval.
The INN system is a dynamic hypertext tool for searching and exploring the WWW. It uses a dynamically built ancillary layer to support easy interaction. This layer features the subexpressions of index expressions that are extracted from rendered documents. Currently, the INN system uses keyword based matching. The effectiveness of the INN system may be increased by using matching functions for index expressions. In the design of such functions, several constraints stemming from the INN must be taken into account. Important constraints are a limited response time and storage space, a focus on discriminating (different notions of) subexpressions for index expressions, and domain independency. With these contextual constraints in mind, several matching functions are designed and both theoretically and practically evaluated.
