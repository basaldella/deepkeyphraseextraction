Computing Symmetric Rank-Revealing Decompositions via Triangular Factorization.
We present a family of algorithms for computing symmetric rank-revealing VSV decompositions based on triangular factorization of the matrix. The VSV decomposition consists of a middle symmetric matrix that reveals the numerical rank in having three blocks with small norm, plus an orthogonal matrix whose columns span approximations to the numerical range and null space. We show that for semidefinite matrices the VSV decomposition should be computed via the ULV decomposition, while for indefinite matrices it must be computed via a URV-like decomposition that involves hypernormal rotations.
