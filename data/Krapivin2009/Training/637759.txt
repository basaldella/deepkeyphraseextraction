Experiences in modeling and simulation of computer architectures in DEVS.
The use of traditional approaches to teach computer organization usually generates misconceptions in the students. The simulated computer ALFA-1 was designed to fill this gap. DEVS was used to attack this complex design of the chosen architecture, allowing for the definition and integration of individual components. DEVS also provided a formal specification framework, which allowed reduction of testing time and improvement of the development process. Using ALFA-1, the students acquired some practice in the design and implementation of hardware components, which is not usually achievable in computer organization courses.
