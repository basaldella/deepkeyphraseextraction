A Primal-Dual Method for Large-Scale Image Reconstruction in Emission Tomography.
In emission tomography, images can be reconstructed from a set of measured projections using a maximum likelihood (ML) criterion. In this paper, we present a primal-dual algorithm for large-scale three-dimensional image reconstruction. The primal-dual method is specialized to the ML reconstruction problem. The reconstruction problem is extremely large; in several of our data sets the Hessian of the objective function is the product of a 1.4 million by 63 million matrix and its scaled transpose. As such, we consider only approaches that are suitable for large-scale parallel computation. We apply a stabilization technique to the system of equations for computing the primal direction and demonstrate the need for stabilization when approximately solving the system using an early-terminated conjugate gradient iteration.We demonstrate that the primal-dual method for this problem converges faster than the logarithmic barrier method and considerably faster than the expectation maximization algorithm. The use of extrapolation in conjunction with the primal-dual method further reduces the overall computation required to achieve convergence.
