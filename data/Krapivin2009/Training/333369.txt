Modeling a Hardware Synthesis Methodology in Isabelle.
Formal Synthesis is a methodology
developed at the university of Kent
for combining circuit design and verification, where a circuit is
constructed from a proof that it meets a given formal specification.
We have reinterpreted this methodology in ISABELLES theory of
higher-order logic so that circuits are incrementally built during
proofs using higher-order resolution. Our interpretation simplifies
and extends Formal Synthesis both conceptually and in implementation.
It also supports integration of this development style with other
proof-based synthesis methodologies and leads to techniques for
developing new classes of circuits, e.g., recursive descriptions of
parametric designs.
