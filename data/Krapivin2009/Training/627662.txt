Unified Integration of Explicit Knowledge and Learning by Example in Recurrent Networks.
AbstractWe propose a novel unified approach for integrating explicit knowledge and learning by example in recurrent networks. The explicit knowledge is represented by automaton rules, which are directly injected into the connections of a network. This can be accomplished by using a technique based on linear programming, instead of learning from random initial weights. Learning is conceived as a refinement process and is mainly responsible for uncertain information management. We present preliminary results for problems of automatic speech recognition.
