A Discrete Event Systems Approach for Protocol Conversion.
A protocol mismatch occurs when heterogeneous networks
try to communicate with each other. Such mismatches are inevitable
due to the proliferation of a multitude of networking architectures,
hardware, and software on one hand, and the need for global connectivity
on the other hand. In order to circumvent this problem the solution
of protocol conversion has been proposed. In this paper we present
a systematic approach to protocol conversion using the theory
of supervisory control of discrete event systems, which was partially
first addressed by Inan. We study the problem of designing a
converter for a given mismatched pair of protocols, using their
specifications, and the specifications for the channel and the
user services. We introduce the notion of converter languages
and use it to obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for
the existence of protocol converter and present an effective
algorithm for computing it whenever it exists.
