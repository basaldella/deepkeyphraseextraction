Incremental Feature Selection.
Feature selection is a problem of finding relevant features.
When the number of features of a dataset is large and its number of patterns
is huge, an effective method of feature selection can help in dimensionality
reduction. An incremental probabilistic algorithm is designed and implemented
as an alternative to the exhaustive and heuristic approaches.
Theoretical analysis is given to
support the idea of the probabilistic algorithm in finding an optimal or
near-optimal subset of features. Experimental results suggest that
(1) the probabilistic algorithm is effective in
obtaining optimal/suboptimal feature subsets; (2) its incremental version
expedites feature selection further when the number of patterns is large
and can scale up without sacrificing the quality of selected
features.
