A Two-Variable Fragment of English.
Controlled languages are regimented fragments of natural language
designed to make the processing of natural language more efficient and
reliable. This paper defines a controlled language, E2V, whose principal
grammatical resources include determiners, relative clauses, reflexives
and pronouns. We provide a formal syntax and semantics for E2V, in which
anaphoric ambiguities are resolved in a linguistically natural way. We
show that the expressive power of E2V is equal to that of the
two-variable fragment of first-order logic. It follows that the problem
of determining the satisfiability of a set of E2V sentences is NEXPTIME
complete. We show that E2V can be extended in various ways without
compromising these complexity results; however, relaxing our policy on
anaphora resolution renders the satisfiability problem for E2V
undecidable. Finally, we argue that our results have a bearing on the
broader philosophical issue of the relationship between natural and
formal languages.
