Class-is-type is inadequate for object reuse.
It is well known that class and type are two different concepts in object-oriented programming languages (OOPLs). However, in many popular OOPLs, classes are used as types. In this paper, we argue that the class-is-type principle is a major obstacle to software reuse, especially to object reuse. The concepts of the basic entities, i.e., objects, object classes, object types, and object kinds, in the type hierarchy of OOPLs are revisited. The notion of object reuse is defined and elaborated. In addition, we show that parameterized types and generic functions are better served by used kind-bounded quantification than universal quantification and other mechanisms.
