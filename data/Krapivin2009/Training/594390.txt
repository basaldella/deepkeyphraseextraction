Fundamental Laws and Assumptions of Software Maintenance.
Researchers must pay far more attention to discovering
and validating the principles that underlie software maintenance
and evolution. This was one of the major conclusions reached
during the International Workshop on Empirical Studies of Software
Maintenance. This workshop, held in November 1996 in Monterey,
California, brought together an international group of researchers
to discuss the successes, challenges and open issues in software
maintenance and evolution.This article documents
the discussion of the subgroup on fundamental laws and assumptions
of software maintenance. The participants of this group included
researchers in software engineering, the behavioral sciences,
information systems and statistics. Their main conclusion was
that insufficient effort has been paid to synthesizing research
conjectures into validated theories and that this problem has
slowed progress in software maintenance. To help support this
vision they identified the following supporting conclusions.
(1) need to develop a genuine scientific approachmore
than just using empirical methods, (2) other disciplines can
help, (3) need to explore a wider range of approaches to empirical
studies, (4) need to study both evolution and maintenance.
