Localizer.
Local search is a traditional technique to solve combinatorial
search problems which has raised much interest in recent years.
The design and implementation of local search algorithms is not
an easy task in general and may require considerable experimentation
and programming effort. However, contrary to global search, little
support is available to assist the design and implementation
of local search algorithms. This paper describes the design and
implementation of Localizer, a modeling language for
implementing local search algorithms. Localizer makes
it possible to express local search algorithms in a notation
close to their informal descriptions in scientific papers. Experimental
results on Boolean satisfiability, graph coloring, graph partitioning,
and job-shop scheduling show the feasibility of the approach.
