Cryptography in Quadratic Function Fields.
We describe several

cryptographic schemes in quadratic function fields of odd characteristic.

In both the real and the imaginary representation of such a field,

we present a Diffie-Hellman-like key exchange protocol as well

as a public-key cryptosystem and a signature scheme of ElGamal

type. Several of these schemes are improvements of systems previously

found in the literature, while others are new. All systems are

based on an appropriate discrete logarithm problem. In the imaginary

setting, this is the discrete logarithm problem in the ideal

class group of the field, or equivalently, in the Jacobian of

the curve defining the function field. In the real case, the

problem in question is the task of computing distances in the

set of reduced principal ideals, which is a monoid under a suitable

operation. Currently, the best general algorithms for solving

both discrete logarithm problems are exponential (subexponential

only in fields of high genus), resulting in a possibly higher

level of security than that of conventional discrete logarithm

based schemes.
