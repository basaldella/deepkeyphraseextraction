Hybrid Fault Simulation for Synchronous Sequential Circuits.
We present a fault simulator for synchronous sequential
circuits that combines the efficiency of three-valued logic
simulation with the exactness of a symbolic approach. The simulator
is hybrid in the sense that three different modes of
operationthree-valued, symbolic and mixedare supported. We
demonstrate how an automatic switching between the modes depending on
the computational resources and the properties of the circuit under
test can be realized, thus trading off time/space for accuracy of the
computation. Furthermore, besides the usual Single Observation Time
Test for the evaluation of the fault coverage, the
simulator supports evaluation according to the more general Multiple
Observation Time Test Strategy (MOT). Numerous experiments are given
to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of our approach. In
particular, it is shown that, at the expense of a reasonable time
penalty, the exactness of the fault coverage computation can be
improved even for the largest benchmark functions.
