Coordinating electronic commerce activities in MANIFOLD.
Modern electronic commerce environments are heavily web-based

and involve issues such as distributed execution, multiuser interactive access

or interface with and use of middleware platforms. Thus, their components

exhibit the properties of communication, cooperation and coordination as in

CSCW, groupware or workflow management systems. In this paper we examine the

potential of using coordination technology to model electronic commerce

activities and we show the benefits of such an approach. Furthermore, we argue

that control-oriented, event-driven coordination models (which

enjoy some inherent properties such as security) are more suitable for

electronic commerce than data-driven ones which are based on accessing an

open shared communication medium in almost unrestricted ways.
