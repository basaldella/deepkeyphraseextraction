Computational paradigms and protection.
We investigate how protection requirements may be specified and implemented using the imperative, availability and coercion paradigms. Conventional protection mechanisms generally follow the imperative paradigm, requiring explicit and often centralized control over the sequencing and the mediation of security critical operations. This paper illustrates how casting protection in the availability and/or coercion styles provides the basis for more flexible and potentially distributed control over the sequencing and mediation of these operations.
