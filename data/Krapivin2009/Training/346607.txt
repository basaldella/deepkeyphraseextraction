Symbolic Cache Analysis for Real-Time Systems.
Caches
impose a major problem for predicting execution times of real-time
systems since the cache behavior depends on the history of previous
memory references. Too pessimistic assumptions on cache hits
can obtain worst-case execution time estimates that are prohibitive
for real-time systems. This paper presents a novel approach for
deriving a highly accurate analytical cache hit function for
C-programs at compile-time based on the assumption that no external
cache interference (e.g. process dispatching or DMA activity)
occurs. First, a  symbolic tracefile of an instrumented C-program
is generated based on  symbolic evaluation, which is a static
technique to determine the dynamic behavior of programs. All
memory references of a program are described by symbolic expressions
and recurrences and stored in chronological order in the symbolic
tracefile. Second, a cache hit function for several cache architectures
is computed based on a  cache evaluation technique. Our approach
goes beyond previous work by precisely modelling program control
flow and program unknowns, modelling large classes of cache architectures,
and providing very accurate cache hit predictions. Examples for
the SPARC architecture are used to illustrate the accuracy and
effectiveness of our symbolic cache prediction.
