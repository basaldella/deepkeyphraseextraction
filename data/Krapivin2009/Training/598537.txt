A Multiphase Level Set Framework for Image Segmentation Using the Mumford and Shah Model.
We propose a new multiphase level set framework for image segmentation using the Mumford and Shah model, for piecewise constant and piecewise smooth optimal approximations. The proposed method is also a generalization of an active contour model without edges based 2-phase segmentation, developed by the authors earlier in T. Chan and L. Vese (1999. In Scale-Space'99, M. Nilsen et al. (Eds.), LNCS, vol. 1682, pp. 141151) and T. Chan and L. Vese (2001. IEEE-IP, 10(2):266277). The multiphase level set formulation is new and of interest on its own: by construction, it automatically avoids the problems of vacuum and overlap&semi; it needs only log n level set functions for n phases in the piecewise constant case&semi; it can represent boundaries with complex topologies, including triple junctions&semi; in the piecewise smooth case, only two level set functions formally suffice to represent any partition, based on The Four-Color Theorem. Finally, we validate the proposed models by numerical results for signal and image denoising and segmentation, implemented using the Osher and Sethian level set method.
