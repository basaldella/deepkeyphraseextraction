On Multirate DS-CDMA Schemes with Interference Cancellation.
This paper investigates interference cancellation (IC) in
direct-sequence code-division multiple access (DS-CDMA) systems that support
multiple data rates. Two methods for implementing multiple data rates are
considered. One is the use of mixed modulation and the other is the use of
multicodes. We introduce and analyze a new approach that combines these
multiple data rate systems with IC. The cancellation in the receiver is
performed successively on each user, starting with the user received with
the highest power. This procedure can in turn be iterated, forming a
multistage scheme, with the number of iterations set as a design parameter.
Our analysis employs a Gaussian approximation for the distribution of the
interference, and it includes both the AWGN and the flat Rayleigh fading
channel. The systems are also evaluated via computer simulations. Our
analysis and simulations indicate that the IC schemes used in mixed
modulation or multicode systems yield a performance close to the single BPSK
user bound and, consequently, give a prospect of a considerable improvement
in performance compared to systems employing matched filter detectors.
