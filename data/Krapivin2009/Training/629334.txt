On the Performance of Synchronized Programs in Distributed Networks with Random Processing Times and Transmission Delays.
A synchronizer is a compiler that transforms a program designed to run in a synchronousnetwork into a program that runs in an asynchronous network. The behavior of a simplesynchronizer, which also represents a basic mechanism for distributed computing and forthe analysis of marked graphs, was studied by S. Even and S. Rajsbaum (1990) under theassumption that message transmission delays and processing times are constant. Westudy the behavior of the simple synchronizer when processing times and transmissiondelays are random. The main performance measure is the rate of a network, i.e., theaverage number of computational steps executed by a processor in the network per unittime. We analyze the effect of the topology and the probability distributions of therandom variables on the behavior of the network. For random variables with exponentialdistribution, we provide tight (i.e., attainable) bounds and study the effect of abottleneck processor on the rate.
