On Harmonic Weight Enumerators of Binary Codes.
We define some new polynomials associated
to a linear binary code and a harmonic function of degree k.
The case k=0 is the usual weight enumerator of the
code. When divided by (xy)^k, they satisfy a MacWilliams
type equality. When applied to certain harmonic functions constructed
from Hahn polynomials, they can compute some information on the
intersection numbers of the code. As an application, we classify
the extremal even formally self-dual codes of length 12.
