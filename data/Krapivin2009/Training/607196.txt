A Hybrid Index Technique for Power Efficient Data Broadcast.
The intention of power conservative indexing techniques for wireless data broadcast is to reduce mobile client tune-in time while maintaining an acceptable data access time. In this paper, we investigate indexing techniques based on index trees and signatures for data disseminated on a broadcast channel. Moreover, a hybrid indexing method combining strengths of the signature and the index tree techniques is proposed. Different from previous studies, our research takes into consideration of two important data organization factors, namely, clustering and scheduling. Cost models for the three indexing methods are derived for various data organization accommodating these two factors. Based on our analytical comparisons, the signature and the hybrid indexing techniques are the best choices for power conservative indexing of various data organization on wireless broadcast channels.
