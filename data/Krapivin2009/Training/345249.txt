A Machine Learning Approach to POS Tagging.
We have applied the inductive learning of statistical
decision trees and relaxation labeling to the Natural Language
Processing (NLP) task of morphosyntactic
disambiguation (Part Of Speech Tagging). The learning process is
supervised and obtains a language model oriented to resolve POS
ambiguities, consisting of a set of statistical decision trees
expressing distribution of tags and words in some relevant contexts.
The acquired decision trees have been directly used in a tagger that
is both relatively simple and fast, and which has been tested and
evaluated on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus with
competitive accuracy. However, better results can be obtained by
translating the trees into rules to feed a flexible relaxation
labeling based tagger. In this direction we describe a tagger which
is able to use information of any kind (n-grams, automatically
acquired constraints, linguistically motivated manually written
constraints, etc.), and in particular to incorporate the
machine-learned decision trees. Simultaneously, we address the
problem of tagging when only limited training material is available,
which is crucial in any process of constructing, from scratch, an
annotated corpus. We show that high levels of accuracy can be
achieved with our system in this situation, and report some results
obtained when using it to develop a 5.5 million words Spanish corpus
from scratch.
