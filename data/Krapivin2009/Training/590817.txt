Evolving Neural Networks to Play Go.
Go is a difficult game for computers to master, and the best go
programs are still weaker than the average human player. Since the
traditional game playing techniques have proven inadequate, new approaches
to computer go need to be studied. This paper presents a new approach to
learning to play go. The SANE (Symbiotic, Adaptive Neuro-Evolution) method
was used to evolve networks capable of playing go on small boards with no
pre-programmed go knowledge. On a 9  9 go board, networks that were
able to defeat a simple computer opponent were evolved within a few hundred
generations. Most significantly, the networks exhibited several aspects of
general go playing, which suggests the approach could scale up well.
