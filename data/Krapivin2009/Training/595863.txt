Temporalizing Epistemic Default Logic.
We present an epistemic default logic, based on the metaphore of a
meta-level architecture. Upward reflection is formalized by a nonmonotonic
entailment relation, based on the objective facts that are either known or
unknown at the object level. Then, the meta (monotonic) reasoning process
generates a number of default-beliefs of object-level formulas. We
extend this framework by proposing a mechanism to reflect these defaults
down. Such a reflection is seen as essentially having a temporal flavour:
defaults derived at the meta-level are projected as facts in a next
object level state. In this way, we obtain temporal models for default
reasoning in meta-level formalisms which can be conceived as labeled
branching trees. Thus, descending the tree corresponds to shifts in time
that model downward reflection, whereas the branching of the tree
corresponds to ways of combining possible defaults. All together, this
yields an operational or procedural semantics of reasoning by default,
which admits one to reason about it by means of branching-time temporal
logic. Finally, we define sceptical and credulous entailment relations
based on these temporal models and we characterize Reiter extensions in
our semantics.
