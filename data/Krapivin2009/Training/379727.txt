Creating trading networks of digital archives.
Digital archives can best survive failures if they have made several c opies of their collections at remote sites. In this paper, we discuss how autonomous sites can cooperate to provide preservation by trading data. We examine the decisions that an archive must make when forming trading networks, such as the amount of storage space to provide and the best number of partner sites. We also deal with the fact that some sites may be more reliable than others. Experimental results from a data trading simulator illustrate which policies are most reliable. Our techniques focus on preserving the ``bits'' of digital collections; other services that focus on other archiving concerns (such as preserving meaningful metadata) can be built on top of the system we describe here.
