An Example of Deriving Performance Properties from a Visual Representation of Program Execution.
AbstractThrough geometry, program visualization can yield performance properties. We derive all possible synchronization sequences and durations of blocking and concurrent execution for two process programs from a visualization mapping processes, synchronization, and program execution to Cartesian graph axes, line segments, and paths, respectively. Relationships to Petri nets are drawn.
