Integrating Computer Algebra into Proof Planning.
Mechanized reasoning systems and computer algebra systems have different
objectives. Their integration is highly desirable, since formal proofs often
involve both of the two different tasks proving and calculating. Even more
important, proof and computation are often interwoven and not easily
separable.In this article we advocate an integration of computer algebra into
mechanized reasoning systems at the proof plan level. This approach allows
us to view the computer algebra algorithms as methods, that is, declarative
representations of the problem-solving knowledge specific to a certain
mathematical domain. Automation can be achieved in many cases by searching
for a hierarchic proof plan at the method level by using suitable
domain-specific control knowledge about the mathematical algorithms. In
other words, the uniform framework of proof planning allows us to solve a
large class of problems that are not automatically solvable by separate
systems.Our approach also gives an answer to the correctness problems inherent in
such an integration. We advocate an approach where the computer algebra
system produces high-level protocol information that can be processed by an
interface to derive proof plans. Such a proof plan in turn can be expanded
to proofs at different levels of abstraction, so the approach is well suited
for producing a high-level verbalized explication as well as for a
low-level, machine-checkable, calculus-level proof.We present an implementation of our ideas and exemplify them using an
automatically solved example.Changes in the criterion of rigor of the proof engender
major revolutions in mathematics. H. Poincar, 1905
