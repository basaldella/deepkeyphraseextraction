Design of Extensible Component-Based Groupware.
Tailoring is identified as a key requirement for CSCW applications.
One major tailoring mechanism is the extension
of an application at run-time to change its behavior.This article shows how synchronous CSCW component-based applications
can be designed to be extensible at run-time.  We
propose to split the act of tailoring into two steps: the
design-time customization of new components in visual
builder tools and their insertion into the running application.
Thus the customization tool is not required to be
part of the application.This article presents a new design pattern for extensibility and
gives several examples based on that pattern.  With
the help of the pattern extensible application frameworks can be
systematically created from a non-extensible
application design.  The different possibilities to place insertion
points into the application design are discussed
with respect to flexibility and ease of deployment.  Finally, we
present the advantages and limitations of this
approach.
