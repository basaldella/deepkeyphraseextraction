Tabu Search for Frequency Assignment in Mobile Radio Networks.
The main goal of the Frequency Assignment Problem in mobile radio
networks consists of assigning a limited number of frequencies to each
radio cell in a cellular network while minimizing electromagnetic
interference due to the reuse of frequencies. This problem, known to be
NP-hard, is of great importance in practice since better solutions will
allow a telecommunications operator to manage larger cellular networks.
This paper presents a new Tabu Search algorithm for this application. The
algorithm is tested on realistic and large problem instances and compared
with other methods based on simulated annealing, constraint programming
and graph coloring algorithms. Empirical evidence shows that the Tabu
algorithm is very competitive by giving the best solutions to the tested
instances.
