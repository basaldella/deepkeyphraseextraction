Animals with Anatomy.
Applying anatomical and physiological principles to model and animate animals achieves greater realism. Underlying components represent bones, muscles, and soft tissue; for speed and simplicity, we can model these from ellipsoids. Muscles stretch across joints, and their orientations, sizes, and shapes change during joint motion. A polygonal skin is automatically generated from the underlying structures. The skin mesh adjusts itself to changes in position under the influence of neighboring skin points and connections to the underlying anatomy. Much of the process is automated but under the control of user-defined parameters. Manipulation and animation of these models occur at comfortable interactive speeds on graphics workstations.
