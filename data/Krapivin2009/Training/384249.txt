Fast priority queues for cached memory.
The cache hierarchy prevalent in todays high performance processors has to be taken into account in order to design algorithms that perform well in practice. This paper advocates the adaption of external memory algorithms to this purpose. This idea and the practical issues involved are exemplified by engineering a fast priority queue suited to external memory and cached memory that is based on k-way merging. It improves previous external memory algorithms by constant factors crucial for transferring it to cached memory. Running in the cache hierarchy of a workstation the algorithm is at least two times faster than an optimized implementation of binary heaps and 4-ary heaps for large inputs.
