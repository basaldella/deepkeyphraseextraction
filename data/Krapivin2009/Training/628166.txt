Nondeterministic, Nonmonotonic Logic Databases.
AbstractWe consider in this paper an extension of Datalog with mechanisms for temporal, nonmonotonic, and nondeterministic reasoning, which we refer to as Datalog++. We show, by means of examples, its flexibility in expressing queries concerning aggregates and data cube. Also, we show how iterated fixpoint and stable model semantics can be combined to the purpose of clarifying the semantics of Datalog++ programs and supporting their efficient execution. Finally, we provide a more concrete implementation strategy on which basis the design of optimization techniques tailored for Datalog++ is addressed.
