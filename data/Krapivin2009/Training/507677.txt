The design of a transport protocol for on-demand graphical rendering.
In recent years there have been significant advances in 3D scanning technologies that allow the creation of meshes with hundreds of millions of polygons. A number of algorithms have been proposed for the display of such large models. These advances, coupled with the steady growth in the speed of network links, have given rise to a new area of interest, the streaming transmission and visualization of three-dimensional data sets. We present a number of issues that must be addressed when designing a transport protocol for three-dimensional images as well as a method of transport. We then evaluate an implementation of an On-Demand Graphic Transport Protocol (OGP) that addresses these issues.
