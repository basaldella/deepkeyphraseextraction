Testing Positiveness of Polynomials.
Many problems in mathematics, logic, computer science, and engineering
can be reduced to the problem of testing positiveness of polynomials (over
real numbers). Although the problem is decidable (shown by Tarski in 1930),
the general decision methods are not always practically applicable because
of their high computational time requirements. Thus several partial methods
were proposed in the field of term rewriting systems. In this paper, we
exactly determine how partial these methods are, and we propose simpler
and/or more efficient methods with the same power.
