Continuous Time Matching Constraints for Image Streams.
Corresponding image points of a rigid object in a discrete sequence
of images fulfil the so-called multilinear constraint.
In this paper the continuous time analogue of this
constraint, for a continuous stream of images, is introduced and studied.
The constraint
links the Taylor series expansion of the motion of the image points with the
Taylor series expansion of the relative motion and orientation between
the object and the camera.
The analysis is done both for calibrated and uncalibrated cameras.
Two simplifications are also presented for the uncalibrated camera
case. One simplification is made using an affine reduction and
the so-called kinetic depths.
The second simplification is based upon a projective
reduction with respect to the image of a planar configuration.
The analysis shows that the constraint involving second-order derivatives
are needed to determine camera motion. Experiments
with real and simulated data are also presented.
