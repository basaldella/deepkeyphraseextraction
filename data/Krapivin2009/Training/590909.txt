Knowledge Extraction from Transducer Neural Networks.
Previously neural networks have shown interesting performance
results for tasks such as classification, but they still
suffer from an insufficient focus on the structure of the
knowledge represented therein. In this paper, we analyze
various knowledge extraction techniques in detail and we develop new
transducer extraction techniques for the interpretation of recurrent
neural network learning. First, we provide an overview of different
possibilities to express structured knowledge using neural
networks. Then, we analyze a type of recurrent network
rigorously, applying a broad range of different techniques.
We argue that analysis techniques, such as
weight analysis using Hinton diagrams, hierarchical cluster analysis, and
principal component analysis may be useful for providing certain views on
the underlying knowledge. However, we demonstrate that these techniques are
too static and too low-level for interpreting
recurrent network classifications. The contribution of
this paper is a particularly broad analysis of knowledge
extraction techniques. Furthermore, we propose dynamic learning analysis
and transducer extraction as two new dynamic interpretation techniques. Dynamic
learning analysis provides a better understanding of
how the network learns, while transducer extraction
provides a better understanding of what the
network represents.
