A fault-tolerant directory service for mobile agents based on forwarding pointers.
A reliable communication layer is an essential component of a mobile agent system. We present a new fault-tolerant directory service for mobile agents, which can be used to route messages to them. The directory service, based on a technique of forwarding pointers, introduces some redundancy in order to ensure resilience to stopping failures of nodes containing forwarding pointers; in addition, it avoids cyclic routing of messages, and it supports a technique to collapse chains of pointers that allows direct communications between agents. We have formalised the algorithm and derived a fully mechanical proof of its correctness using the proof assistant Coq; we report on our experience of designing the algorithm and deriving its proof of correctness. The complete source code of the proof is made available from the WWW.
