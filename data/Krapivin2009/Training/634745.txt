Monotonicity and Collective Quantification.
This article studies the monotonicity behavior of plural determiners
that quantify over collections. Following previous work, we describe the
collective interpretation of determiners such as all, some and
most using generalized quantifiers of a higher type that are
obtained systematically by applying a type shifting operator to the
standard meanings of determiners in Generalized Quantifier Theory. Two
processes of counting and existential quantification that
appear with plural quantifiers are unified into a single determiner
fitting operator, which, unlike previous proposals, both captures
existential quantification with plural determiners and respects their
monotonicity properties. However, some previously unnoticed facts
indicate that monotonicity of plural determiners is not always preserved
when they apply to collective predicates. We show that the proposed
operator describes this behavior correctly, and characterize the
monotonicity of the collective determiners it derives. It is proved that
determiner fitting always preserves monotonicity properties of
determiners in their second argument, but monotonicity in the first
argument of a determiner is preserved if and only if it is monotonic in
the same direction in the second argument. We argue that this asymmetry
follows from the conservativity of generalized quantifiers in
natural language.
