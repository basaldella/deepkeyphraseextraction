Resource-Bounded Kolmogorov Complexity Revisited.
We take a fresh look at CD complexity, where CDt(x) is the size of the smallest program that distinguishes x from all other strings in time t(|x|). We also look at CND complexity, a new nondeterministic variant of CD complexity, and time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity, denoted by C complexity.We show several results relating time-bounded C, CD, and CND complexity and their applications to a variety of questions in computational complexity theory, including the following:  Showing how to approximate the size of a set using CD complexity without using the random string as needed in Sipser's earlier proof of a similar result. Also, we give a new simpler proof of this result of Sipser's.  Improving these bounds for almost all strings, using extractors.  A proof of the Valiant--Vazirani lemma directly from Sipser's earlier CD lemma.  A relativized lower bound for CND complexity. Exact characterizations of equivalences between C, CD, and CND complexity.  Showing that satisfying assignments of a satisfiable Boolean formula can be enumerated in time polynomial in the size of the output if and only if a unique assignment can be found quickly. This answers an open question of Papadimitriou.  A new Kolmogorov complexity-based proof that BPP\subseteq\Sigma_2^p$.  New Kolmogorov complexity based constructions of the following relativized worlds: There exists an infinite set in P with no sparse infinite NP subsets.   EXP=NEXP but there exists a NEXP machine whose accepting paths cannot be found in exponential time.  Satisfying assignments cannot be found with nonadaptive queries to SAT.
