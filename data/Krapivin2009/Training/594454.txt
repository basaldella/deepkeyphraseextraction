A Function Point-Like Measure for Object-Oriented Software.
We
present a method for estimating the size, and consequently effort
and duration, of object oriented software development projects.
Different estimates may be made in different phases of the development
process, according to the available information. We define an
adaptation of traditional function points, called Object Oriented
Function Points, to enable the measurement of object oriented
analysis and design specifications. Tools have been constructed
to automate the counting method. The novel aspect of our method
is its flexibility. An organization can experiment with different
counting policies, to find the most accurate predictors of size,
effort, etc. in its environment. The method and preliminary results
of its application in an industrial environment are presented
and discussed.
