Interactive video streaming with proxy servers.
We study caching strategies for proxies that cache VBR-encoded continuous media objects for highly interactive streaming applications. First, we develop a model for streaming VBR-encoded continuous media objects. This model forms the basis for a stream admission control criterion and our study of caching strategies. We find that unlike conventional web caches, proxy caches for continuous media objects need to replicate or stripe objects to achieve high hit rates. We develop novel caching strategies that either implicitly or explicitly track the request pattern and cache (and replicate) objects accordingly. Our numerical results indicate that our caching strategies achieve significantly higher hit rates than caching without object replication.
