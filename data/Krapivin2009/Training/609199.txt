Continuation-Based Multiprocessing.
Any multiprocessing facility must include three features:
elementary exclusion, data protection, and process saving. While
elementary exclusion must rest on some hardware
facility (e.g., a test-and-set instruction), the other two
requirements are fulfilled by features already present
in applicative languages. Data protection may be obtained through
the use of procedures (closures or funargs), and process
saving may be obtained through the use of the catch operator. The use of
catch, in particular, allows an elegant
treatment of process saving.We demonstrate these techniques by writing the kernel and
some modules for a multiprocessing system. The kernel is very
small. Many functions which one would normally expect to find
inside the kernel are completely decentralized. We consider
the implementation of other schedulers, interrupts, and the
implications of these ideas for language design.
