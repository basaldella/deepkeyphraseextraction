Deterministic parallel backtrack search.
The backtrack search problem involves visiting all the nodes of an arbitrary binary tree given a pointer to its root subject to the constraint that the children of a node are revealed only after their parent is visited. We present a fast, deterministic backtrack search algorithm for a p-processor COMMON CRCW-PRAM, which visits any n-node tree of height h in time O((n/p+h)(logloglogp)22). This upper bound compares favourably with a natural &Ohgr;(n/p+h) lower bound for this problem. Our approach embodies novel, efficient techniques for dynamically assigning tree-nodes to processors to ensure that the work is shared equitably among them.
