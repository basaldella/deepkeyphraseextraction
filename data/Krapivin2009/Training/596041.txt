Towards the Use of Automated Reasoning in Discourse Disambiguation.
In this paper, we claim that the disambiguation of
referring expressions in discourse can be formulated in terms automated
reasoners can address. Specifically, we show that consistency,
informativity and minimality are criteria which (i) can be implemented
using automated reasoning tools and (ii) can be used to disambiguate
noun-noun compounds, metonymy and definite descriptions.
