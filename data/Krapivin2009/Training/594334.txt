Checking Simple Properties of Transition Systems Defined by Thue Specifications.
In (possibly infinite) deterministic labeled transition systems defined by Thue congruences, labels are considered as functions of states into states. This paper provides a method for computing domains of such functions for a large class of transition systems. The latter are related to model checking of transition systems defined by Thue congruences.
