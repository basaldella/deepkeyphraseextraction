Asynchronous Problems on SIMD Parallel Computers.
AbstractOne of the essential problems in parallel computing is: Can SIMD machines handle asynchronous problems? This is a difficult, unsolved problem because of the mismatch between asynchronous problems and SIMD architectures. We propose a solution to let SIMD machines handle general asynchronous problems. Our approach is to implement a runtime support system which can run MIMD-like software on SIMD hardware. The runtime support system, named P kernel, is thread-based. There are two major advantages of the thread-based model. First, for application problems with irregular and/or unpredictable features, automatic scheduling can move some threads from overloaded processors to underloaded processors. Second, and more importantly, the granularity of threads can be controlled to reduce system overhead. The P kernel is also able to handle bookkeeping and message management, as well as to make these low-level tasks transparent to users. Substantial performance has been obtained on Maspar MP-1.
