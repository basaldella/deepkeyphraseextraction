A column approximate minimum degree ordering algorithm.
Sparse Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting computes the factorization of a sparse matrix A, where the row ordering P is selected during factorization using standard partial pivoting with row interchanges. The goal is to select a column preordering, Q, based solely on the nonzero pattern of A, that limits the worst-case number of nonzeros in the factorization. The fill-in also depends on P, but Q is selected to reduce an upper bound on the fill-in for any subsequent choice of P. The choice of Q can have a dramatic impact on the number of nonzeros in L and U. One scheme for determining a good column ordering for A is to compute a symmetric ordering that reduces fill-in in the Cholesky factorization of ATA. A conventional minimum degree ordering algorithm would require the sparsity structure of ATA to be computed, which can be expensive both in terms of space and time since ATA may be much denser than A. An alternative is to compute Q directly from the sparsity structure of A; this strategy is used by MATLAB's COLMMD preordering algorithm. A new ordering algorithm, COLAMD, is presented. It is based on the same strategy but uses a better ordering heuristic. COLAMD is faster and computes better orderings, with fewer nonzeros in the factors of the matrix.
