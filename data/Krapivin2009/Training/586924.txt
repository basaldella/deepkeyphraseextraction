A Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme for General Multiprocessor Job Scheduling.
Recently, there have been considerable interests in the multiprocessor job scheduling problem, in which a job can be processed in parallel on one of several alternative subsets of processors.  In this paper, a polynomial time approximation scheme is presented for the problem in which the number of processors in the system is a fixed constant.  This result is the best possible because of the strong NP-hardness of the problem and is a significant improvement over the past results: the best previous result was an approximation algorithm of ratio $7/6 + \epsilon$ for 3-processor systems based on Goemans's algorithm for a restricted version of the problem.
