Visualizing implicit queries for information management and retrieval.
In this paper, we describe the use of similarity metrics in a
novel visual environment for storing and retrieving favorite web
pages. The similarity metrics, called Implicit Queries, are
used to automatically highlight stored web pages that are related
to the currently selected web page. Two experiments explored how
users manage their personal web information space with and without
the Implicit Query highlighting and later retrieve their stored web
pages. When storing and organizing web pages, users with Implicit
Query highlighting generated slightly more categories. Implicit
Queries also led to faster web page retrieval time, although the
results were not statistically significant.
