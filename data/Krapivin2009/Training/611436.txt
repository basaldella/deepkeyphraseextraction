Approaches to zerotree image and video coding on MIMD architectures.
The wavelet transform is more and more widely used in image and video compression. One of the best known algorithms in image compression is the set partitioning in hierarchical trees algorithm which involves the wavelet transform. As today the parallelisation of the wavelet transform is sufficiently investigated, this work deals with the parallelisation of the compression algorithm itself as a next step. Two competitive approaches are presented: one is a direct parallelisation and the other uses an altered algorithm which suits better to the parallel architecture.
