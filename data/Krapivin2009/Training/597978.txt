Fluid approximations for a processor-sharing queue.
In this paper a fluid approximation, also known as a functional

strong law of large numbers (FSLLN) for a GI/G/1 queue

under a processor-sharing service discipline is established and its

properties are analysed. The fluid limit depends on the arrival rate, the

service time distribution of the initial customers, and the service time

distribution of the arriving customers. This is in contrast to the known result

for the GI/G/1 queue under a FIFO service discipline, where the

fluid limit is piecewise linear and depends on the service time distribution

only through its mean. The piecewise linear form of the limit can be recovered

by an equilibrium type choice of the initial service distribution.
