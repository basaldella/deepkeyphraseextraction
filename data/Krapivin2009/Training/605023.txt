Challenges of component-based development.
It is generally understood that building software systems with components has many advantages but the difficulties of this approach should not be ignored. System evolution, maintenance, migration and compatibilities are some of the challenges met with when developing a component-based software system. Since most systems evolve over time, components must be maintained or replaced. The evolution of requirements affects not only specific system functions and particular components but also component-based architecture on all levels. Increased complexity is a consequence of different components and systems having different life cycles. In component-based systems it is easier to replace part of system with a commercial component. This process is however not straightforward and different factors such as requirements management, marketing issues, etc., must be taken into consideration. In this paper we discuss the issues and challenges encountered when developing and using an evolving component-based software system. An industrial control system has been used as a case study.
