Rational
Under general conditions, linear decision rules of agents
with rational expectations are equivalent to restricted error corrections.
However, empirical rejections of rational expectation restrictions are the
rule, rather than the exception, in macroeconomics. Rejections often are
conditioned on the assumption that agents aim to smooth only the levels of
actions or are subject to geometric random delays. Generalizations of
dynamic frictions on agent activities are suggested that yield
closed-form, higher-order decision rules with improved statistical
fits and infrequent rejections of rational expectations restrictions.
Properties of these generalized `rational' error corrections are illustrated
for producer pricing in manufacturing industries.
