Bayesian MARS.
A Bayesian approach to multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) fitting
(Friedman, 1991) is proposed. This takes the form of a probability distribution over the
space of possible MARS models which is explored using reversible jump Markov chain Monte
Carlo methods (Green, 1995). The generated sample of MARS models produced is shown to have
good predictive power when averaged and allows easy interpretation of the relative
importance of predictors to the overall fit.
