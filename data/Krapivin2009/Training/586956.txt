Hardness of Approximate Hypergraph Coloring.
We introduce the notion of covering complexity of a verifier for probabilistically checkable proofs (PCPs). Such a verifier is given an input, a claimed theorem, and an oracle, representing a purported proof of the theorem. The verifier is also given a random string and decides whether to accept the proof or not, based on the given random string. We define the covering complexity of such a verifier, on a given input, to be the minimum number of proofs needed to "satisfy" the verifier on every random string; i.e., on every random string, at least one of the given proofs must be accepted by the verifier.  The covering complexity of PCP verifiers offers a promising route to getting stronger inapproximability results for some minimization problems and, in particular, (hyper)graph coloring problems.  We present a PCP verifier for NP statements that queries only four bits and yet has a covering complexity of one for true statements and a superconstant covering complexity for statements not in the language. Moreover, the acceptance predicate of this verifier is a simple not-all-equal check on the four bits it reads. This enables us to prove that, for any constant c, it is NP-hard to color a 2-colorable 4-uniform hypergraph using just c colors and also yields a superconstant inapproximability result under a stronger hardness assumption.
