Optimizing Queries with Object Updates.
Object-oriented databases (OODBs) provide powerful data
abstractions and modeling facilities but they usually lack a suitable
framework for query processing and optimization. Even though there
is an increasing number of recent proposals on OODB query
optimization, only few of them are actually focused on query
optimization in the presence of object identity and destructive
updates, features often supported by most realistic OODB languages.
This paper presents a formal framework for optimizing object-oriented
queries in the presence of side effects. These queries may contain
object updates at any place and in any form. We present a language
extension to the monoid comprehension calculus to express these
object-oriented features and we give a formal meaning to these
extensions. Our method is based on denotational semantics, which is
often used to give a formal meaning to imperative programming
languages. The semantics of our language extensions is expressed in
terms of our monoid calculus, without the need of any fundamental
change to our basic framework. Our method not only maintains
referential transparency, which allows us to do meaningful query
optimization, but it is also practical for optimizing OODB queries
since it allows the same optimization techniques applied to regular
queries to be used with minimal changes for OODB queries with
updates.
