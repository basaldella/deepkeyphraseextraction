Cactus Tools for Grid Applications.
Cactus is an open source problem solving environment designed for scientists and engineers. Its modular structure facilitates parallel computation across different architectures and collaborative code development between different groups. The Cactus Code originated in the academic research community, where it has been developed and used over many years by a large international collaboration of physicists and computational scientists. We discuss here how the intensive computing requirements of physics applications now using the Cactus Code encourage the use of distributed and metacomputing, and detail how its design makes it an ideal application test-bed for Grid computing. We describe the development of tools, and the experiments which have already been performed in a Grid environment with Cactus, including distributed simulations, remote monitoring and steering, and data handling and visualization. Finally, we discuss how Grid portals, such as those already developed for Cactus, will open the door to global computing resources for scientific users.
