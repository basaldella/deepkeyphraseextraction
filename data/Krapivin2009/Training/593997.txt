Skeleton Trees for the Efficient Decoding of Huffman Encoded Texts.
A new data structure is investigated, which allows fast decoding of texts encoded by canonical Huffman codes. The storage requirements are much lower than for conventional Huffman trees, O(log^2 n) for trees of depth O(log n), and decoding is faster, because a part of the bit-comparisons necessary for the decoding may be saved. Empirical results on large real-life distributions show a reduction of up to 50% and more in the number of bit operations. The basic idea is then generalized, yielding further savings.
