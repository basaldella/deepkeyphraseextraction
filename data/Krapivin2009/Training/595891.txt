Reasoning about Information Change.
In this paper we introduce Dynamic Epistemic Logic, which is a
logic for reasoning about information change in a multi-agent system. The
information structures we use are based on non-well-founded sets, and can
be conceived as bisimulation classes of Kripke models. On these structures,
we define a notion of information change that is inspired by Update
Semantics (Veltman, 1996). We give a sound and complete axiomatization of
the resulting logic, and we discuss applications to the puzzle of the dirty
children, and to knowledge programs.
