Emergent Semantics through Interaction in Image Databases.
AbstractIn this paper, we briefly discuss some aspects of image semantics and the role that it plays for the design of image databases. We argue that images don't have an intrinsic meaning, but that they are endowed with a meaning by placing them in the context of other images and by the user interaction. From this observation, we conclude that, in an image, database users should be allowed to manipulate not only the individual images, but also the relation between them. We present an interface model based on the manipulation of configurations of images.
