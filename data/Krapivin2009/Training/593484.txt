Parallel Formulations of Decision-Tree Classification Algorithms.
Classification decision tree algorithms are used
extensively for data mining in many domains such as retail target
marketing, fraud detection, etc. Highly parallel algorithms for
constructing classification decision trees are desirable for dealing
with large data sets in reasonable amount of time. Algorithms for
building classification decision trees have a natural concurrency,
but are difficult to parallelize due to the inherent dynamic nature
of the computation. In this paper, we present parallel formulations
of classification decision tree learning algorithm based on
induction. We describe two basic parallel formulations. One is
based on Synchronous Tree Construction Approach and the other
is based on Partitioned Tree Construction Approach. We discuss
the advantages and disadvantages of using these methods and propose a
hybrid method that employs the good features of these methods. We
also provide the analysis of the cost of computation and
communication of the proposed hybrid method. Moreover, experimental
results on an IBM SP-2 demonstrate excellent speedups and
scalability.
