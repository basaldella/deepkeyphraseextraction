Visualization of Geometric Algorithms.
AbstractThis paper investigates the visualization of geometric algorithms. We discuss how limiting the domain makes it possible to create a system that enables others to use it easily. Knowledge about the domain can be very helpful in building a system which automates large parts of the users task. A system can be designed to isolate the user from any concern about how graphics is done. The application need only specify what happens and need not be concerned with how to make it happen on the screen. We develop a conceptual model and a framework for experimenting with it. We also present a system, GASP, which implements this model. GASP allows quick generation of three-dimensional geometric algorithm visualizations, even for highly complex algorithms. It also provides a visual debugging facility for geometric computing. We show the utility of GASP by presenting a variety of examples.
