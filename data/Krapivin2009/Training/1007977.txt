Theory and applications of inverting functions as folds.
This paper is devoted to the proof, applications, and generalisation of a theorem, due to Bird and de Moor, that gave conditions under which a total function can be expressed as a relational fold. The theorem is illustrated with three problems, all dealing with constructing trees with various properties. It is then generalised to give conditions under which the inverse of a partial function can be expressed as a relational hylomorphism. Its proof makes use of Doornbos and Backhouse's theory on well-foundedness and reductivity. Possible applications of the generalised theorem is discussed.
