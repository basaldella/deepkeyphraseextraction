A cryptographic solution to implement access control in a hierarchy and more.
The need for access control in a hierarchy arises in several
different contexts. One such context is managing the information of
an organization where the users are divided into different security
classes depending on who has access to what. Several cryptographic
solutions have been proposed to address this problem --- the
solutions are based on generating cryptographic keys for each
security class such that the key for a lower level security class
depends on the key for the security class that is higher up in the
hierarchy. Most solutions use complex cryptographic techniques:
integrating these into existing systems may not be trivial. Others
have impractical requirement: if a user at a security level wants
to access data at lower levels, then all intermediate nodes must be
traversed. Moreover, if there is an access control policy that does
not conform to the hierarchical structure, such policy cannot be
handled by existing solutions. We propose a new solution that
overcomes the above mentioned shortcomings. Our solution not only
addresses the problem of access control in a hierarchy but also can
be used for general cases. It is a scheme similar to the RSA
cryptosystem and can be easily incorporated in existing systems.
