Globally Consistent Range Scan Alignment for Environment Mapping.
A robot exploring an unknown environment may need to build a world
model from sensor measurements. In order to integrate all the frames
of sensor data, it is essential to align the data properly. An
incremental approach has been typically used in the past, in which
each local frame of data is aligned to a cumulative global model, and
then merged to the model. Because different parts of the model are
updated independently while there are errors in the registration,
such an approach may result in an inconsistent model.In this paper, we study the problem of consistent registration of
multiple frames of measurements (range scans), together with the
related issues of representation and manipulation of spatial
uncertainties. Our approach is to maintain all the local frames of
data as well as the relative spatial relationships between local
frames. These spatial relationships are modeled as random variables
and are derived from matching pairwise scans or from odometry. Then
we formulate a procedure based on the maximum likelihood criterion to
optimally combine all the spatial relations. Consistency is achieved
by using all the spatial relations as constraints to solve for the
data frame poses simultaneously. Experiments with both simulated and
real data will be presented.
