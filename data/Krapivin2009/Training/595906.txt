Communication across Viewpoints.
A case situation arising in a normal interaction among people is the
baseline for discussing properties of the theory of viewpoints. In
particular we consider how to ensure agreement on the meaning of certain
utterances by agents who have different perspectives on the situation, while
maintaning other knowledge as private. We argue that communication should be
modeled as adding facts to the common knowledge of agents. We introduce the
principle of referent sharing in communications and argue that common
knowledge resulting from communication should only use constants whose
referent is manifest to the parties involved.
