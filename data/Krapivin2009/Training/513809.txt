Priority scheduling in wireless ad hoc networks.
Ad hoc networks formed without the aid of any established infrastructure are typically multi-hop networks. Location dependent contention and "hidden terminal" problem make priority scheduling in multi-hop networks significantly different from that in wireless LANs. Most of the prior work related to priority scheduling addresses issues in wireless LANs. In this paper, priority scheduling in multi-hop networks is discussed. We propose a scheme using two narrow-band busy tone signals to ensure medium access for high priority source stations. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.
