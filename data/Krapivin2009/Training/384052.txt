A framework for semantic reasoning about Byzantine quorum systems.
We have defined a class of shared variables called TS-variables that includes those implemented by the various Byzantine quorum system constructions of Malkhi and Reiter, and developed a number of definitions and theorems enabling us to reason about these variables abstractly. Using these tools, we have reduced the problem of Lamport's atomic semantics for such variables to the simpler problem of regular semantics. We discuss the fact that both these problems have remained stubbornly difficult to solve for some types of Byzantine quorum system variables (notably masking quorum system variables) by showing that they are not solvable by traditional approaches in an asynchronous environment. Finally, for such variables we define the notion of pseudoregular and pseudoatomic semantics, and state briefly that a similar reduction holds for these concepts.
