Slipping and Tripping Reflexes for Bipedal Robots.
Many robot applications require legged robots to traverse rough or
unmodeled terrain. This paper explores strategies that would enable
legged robots to respond to two common types of surface contact
error: slipping and tripping. Because of the rapid response required
and the difficulty of sensing uneven terrain, we propose a set of
reflexes that would permit the robot to react without modeling or
analyzing the error condition in detail. These reflexive responses
allow robust recovery from a variety of contact errors. We present
simulation trials for single-slip tasks with varying coefficients of
friction and single-trip tasks with varying obstacle heights.
