A Controlled Skip Parser.
Real-world natural language sentences are often long and complex, and
contain unexpected grammatical constructions. They even include noise
and ungrammaticality. This paper describes the Controlled Skip
Parser, a program that parses such real-world sentences by skipping
some of the words in the sentence. The new feature of this parser is that it
controls its behavior by finding out which words to skip, without using
domain-specific knowledge. The parser is a priority-based chart
parser. By assigning appropriate priority levels to the constituents
in the chart, the parsers behavior is controlled. Statistical
information is used for assigning priority levels. The statistical
information (n-grams) can be thought of as a generalized approximation
of the grammar learned from past successful experiences. The control
mechanism gives a great speed-up and reduction in memory usage.
Experiments on real newspaper articles are shown, and our experience
with this parser in a machine translation system is described.
