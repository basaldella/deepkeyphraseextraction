A Real-Time Photo-Realistic Visual Flythrough.
AbstractIn this paper we present a comprehensive flythrough system which generates photo-realistic images in true real-time. The high performance is due to an innovative rendering algorithm based on a discrete ray casting approach, accelerated by ray coherence and multiresolution traversal. The terrain as well as the 3D objects are represented by a textured mapped voxel-based model. The system is based on a pure software algorithm and is thus portable. It was first implemented on a workstation and then ported to a general-purpose parallel architecture to achieve real-time performance.
