Off-Line Parsability and the Well-Foundedness of Subsumption.
Typed feature structures are used extensively for the specification of
linguistic information in many formalisms. The subsumption relation
orders TFSs by their information content. We prove that subsumption of
acyclic TFSs is well founded, whereas in the presence of cycles
general TFS subsumption is not well founded. We show an application of
this result for parsing, where the well-foundedness of subsumption is
used to guarantee termination for grammars that are off-line
parsable. We define a new version of off-line parsability that is less
strict than the existing one; thus termination is guaranteed for
parsing with a larger set of grammars.
