Dense Features for Semi-Dense Stereo Correspondence.
We present a new feature based algorithm for stereo correspondence. Most of the previous feature based methods match sparse features like edge pixels, producing only sparse disparity maps. Our algorithm detects and matches dense features between the left and right images of a stereo pair, producing a semi-dense disparity map. Our dense feature is defined with respect to both images of a stereo pair, and it is computed during the stereo matching process, not a preprocessing step. In essence, a dense feature is a connected set of pixels in the left image and a corresponding set of pixels in the right image such that the intensity edges on the boundary of these sets are stronger than their matching error (which is the difference in intensities between corresponding boundary pixels). Our algorithm produces accurate semi-dense disparity maps, leaving featureless regions in the scene unmatched. It is robust, requires little parameter tuning, can handle brightness differences between images, nonlinear errors, and is fast (linear complexity).
