On reducing the processing cost of on-demand QoS path computation.
Quality of Service (QoS) routing algorithms have become the
focus of recent research due to their potential for increasing the
utilization of an Integrated Services Packet Network (ISPN) serving
requests with QoS requirements. While heuristics for determining
paths for such requests have been formulated for a variety of QoS
models, little attention has been given to the overall processing
complexity of the QoS routing protocol. This paper deals with the
processing complexity of determining QoS paths in link state based
routing architectures. Although on-demand path computation is very
attractive due to its simplicity, many believe that its processing
cost will be prohibitive in environments with high request rates.
In this work, we first characterize the processing cost of QoS
routing algorithms that use the widest-shortest path heuristic.
Then we study alternatives to on-demand path computation that can
reduce this processing overhead. In addition to the well known
solution of path pre-computation, we introduce and study path
caching, an incremental modification of on-demand path computation.
By simulating realistic topologies and traffic conditions we
investigate the performance of both alternatives. Our results show
that caching is an effective alternative to path pre-computation
and that both path caching and pre-computation can achieve
significant processing cost savings without severely compromising
routing performance.
