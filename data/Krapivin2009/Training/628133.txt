Data Semantics for Improving Retrieval Performance of Digital News Video Systems.
AbstractWe propose a novel four-step hybrid approach for retrieval and composition of video newscasts based on information contained in different metadata sets. In the first step, we use conventional retrieval techniques to isolate video segments from the data universe using segment metadata. In the second step, retrieved segments are clustered into potential news items using a dynamic technique sensitive to the information contained in the segments. In the third step, we apply a transitive search technique to increase the recall of the retrieval system. In the final step, we increase recall performance by identifying segments possessing creation-time relationships. A quantitative analysis of the performance of the process on a newscast composition shows an increase in recall by 59 percent over the conventional keyword-based search technique used in the first step.
