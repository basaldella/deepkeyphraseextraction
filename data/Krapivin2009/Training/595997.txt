Beyond the Turing Test.
The main factor of intelligence is defined as the ability to

comprehend, formalising this ability with the help of new constructs

based on descriptional complexity. The result is a comprehension test,

or C-test, which is exclusively defined in computational terms. Due to

its absolute and non-anthropomorphic character, it is equally applicable

to both humans and non-humans. Moreover, it correlates with classical

psychometric tests, thus establishing the first firm connection between

information theoretical notions and traditional IQ tests. The Turing

Test is compared with the C-test and the combination of the two is

questioned. In consequence, the idea of using the Turing Test as a

practical test of intelligence should be surpassed, and substituted by

computational and factorial tests of different cognitive abilities, a

much more useful approach for artificial intelligence progress and for

many other intriguing questions that present themselves beyond the

Turing Test.
