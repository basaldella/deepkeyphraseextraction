The TPTP Problem Library.
This paper provides a detailed description of the CNF part of the TPTP
Problem Library for automated theorem-proving systems. The library is
available via the Internet and forms a common basis for development and
experimentation with automated theorem provers. This paper explains the
motivations and reasoning behind the development of the TPTP (thus
implicitly explaining the design decisions made) and describes the TPTP
contents and organization. It also provides guidelines for obtaining and
using the library, summary statistics about release v1.2.1, and an overview
of the tptp2X utility program. References for all the sources of TPTP
problems are provided.
