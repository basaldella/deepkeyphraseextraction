Searching for a Global Search Algorithm.
We report on a case study to assess the use of an advanced
knowledge-based software design technique with programmers who have not
participated in the techniques development. We use the KIDS approach
to algorithm design to construct two global search algorithms that
route baggage through a transportation net. Construction of the second
algorithm involves extending the KIDS knowledge base. Experience with
the case study leads us to integrate the approach with the spiral and
prototyping models of software engineering, and to discuss ways to deal
with incomplete design knowledge.
