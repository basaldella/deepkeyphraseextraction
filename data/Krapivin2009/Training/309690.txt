Minimal Decomposition of Model-Based Invariants.
Model-based invariants are relations between model
parameters and image measurements, which are independent of the
imaging parameters. Such relations are true for all images of
the model. Here we describe an algorithm which, given L
independent model-based polynomial invariants describing some
shape, will provide a linear re-parameterization of the
invariants. This re-parameterization has the properties that: (i)
it includes the minimal number of terms, and (ii) the
shape terms are the same in all the model-based
invariants. This final representation has 2 main applications: (1)
it gives new representations of shape in terms of
hyperplanes, which are convenient for object recognition&semi; (2) it
allows the design of new linear shape from motion algorithms. In
addition, we use this representation to identify object classes
that have universal invariants.
