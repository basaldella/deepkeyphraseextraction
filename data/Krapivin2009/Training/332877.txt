Design and Implementation of Efficient Message Scheduling for Controller Area Network.
AbstractThe Controller Area Network (CAN) is being widely used in real-time control applications such as automobiles, aircraft, and automated factories. In this paper, we present the mixed traffic scheduler (MTS) for CAN, which provides higher schedulability than fixed-priority schemes like deadline-monotonic (DM) while incurring less overhead than dynamic earliest-deadline (ED) scheduling. We also describe how MTS can be implemented on existing CAN network adapters such as Motorola's TouCAN. In previous work [1], [2], we had shown MTS to be far superior to DM in schedulability performance. In this paper, we present implementation overhead measurements showing that processing needed to support MTS consumes only about 5 to 6 percent of CPU time. Considering its schedulability advantage, this makes MTS ideal for use in control applications.
