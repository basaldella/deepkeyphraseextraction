Further Experiences with Scenarios and Checklists.
Software inspection is one of the best methods of verifying
software documents. Software inspection is a complex process,
with many possible variations, most of which have received little
or no evaluation. This paper reports on the evaluation of one
component of the inspection process, detection aids, specifically
using Scenario or Checklist approaches. The evaluation is by
subject-based experimentation, and is currently one of three
independent experiments on the same hypothesis. The paper describes
the experimental process, the resulting analysis of the experimental
data, and attempts to compare the results in this experiment
with the other experiments. This replication is broadly supportive
of the results from the original experiment, namely, that the
Scenario approach is superior to the Checklist approach; and
that the meeting component of a software inspection is not an
effective defect detection mechanism. This experiment also tentatively
proposes additional relationships between general academic performance
and individual inspection performance; and between meeting loss
and group inspection performance.
