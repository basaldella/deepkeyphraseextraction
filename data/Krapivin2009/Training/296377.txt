Extracting Hidden Context.
Concept drift due to hidden changes in context complicates learning
in many domains including financial prediction, medical diagnosis, and
communication network performance. Existing machine learning approaches to
this problem use an incremental learning, on-line paradigm. Batch, off-line
learners tend to be ineffective in domains with hidden changes in context as
they assume that the training set is homogeneous. An off-line,
meta-learning approach for the identification of hidden context is
presented. The new approach uses an existing batch learner and the process
of {\it contextual clustering} to identify stable hidden
contexts and the associated context specific, locally stable concepts. The
approach is broadly applicable to the extraction of context reflected in
time and spatial attributes. Several algorithms for the approach are
presented and evaluated. A successful application of the approach to a
complex flight simulator control task is also presented.
