A feedback based rate control algorithm for multicast transmitted video conferencing.
This paper presents a feedback based rate control algorithm for
video conferencing on the Internet. This algorithm adaptively
controls the transmission rate of a video stream, which is being
multicast to a heterogeneous group of receivers. The fact that the
sender is transmitting a single video stream to many receivers
introduces a number of issues. These issues include the variable
nature of the available network resources and the fact that there
is no easy way to determine the availability of these resources. In
addition, even if we were able to track closely the changing
network conditions, the best transmission rate for the aggregate
means a trade off between high and low end receivers.

The algorithm presented in this paper, called the Target
Bandwidth Rate Control Algorithm, dynamically controls the output
rate of the video coder by receiving and processing bandwidth
levels from each receiver in the videoconference. The goal of this
algorithm is to maximize the aggregate amount of video displayable
at the receivers. This algorithm also allows us to limit the worst
case loss experienced by the low-end receivers. In addition to
considering the available network bandwidth in the feedback
information, this algorithm allows for workstation and user
requirements to be considered when determining the senders output
rate.

In order to show the effectiveness of this approach, we first
analyze the algorithms performance in a simulation environment. In
this set of tests we study the effects of different configurations
of receivers in terms of the number of receivers and availability
of resources. Additionally, we have implemented this algorithm in
the VIC video conferencing system in order to analyze its
effectiveness under real network conditions.
