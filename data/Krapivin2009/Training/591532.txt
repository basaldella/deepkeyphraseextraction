A Robotic Excavator for Autonomous Truck Loading.
Excavators are used for the rapid removal of soil and other
materials in mines, quarries, and construction sites. The automation
of these machines offers promise for increasing productivity and
improving safety. To date, most research in this area has focussed on
selected parts of the problem. In this paper, we present a system
that completely automates the truck loading task. The excavator uses
two scanning laser rangefinders to recognize and localize the truck,
measure the soil face, and detect obstacles. The excavators software
decides where to dig in the soil, where to dump in the truck, and how
to quickly move between these points while detecting and stopping for
obstacles. The system was fully implemented and was demonstrated to
load trucks as fast as human operators.
