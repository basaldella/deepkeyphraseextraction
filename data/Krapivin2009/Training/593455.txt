High Performance OLAP and Data Mining on Parallel Computers.
On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) techniques are increasingly
being used in decision support systems to provide analysis of data. Queries
posed on such systems are quite complex and require different views of
data. Analytical models need to capture the multidimensionality of the
underlying data, a task for which multidimensional databases are well
suited. Multidimensional OLAP systems store data in multidimensional arrays
on which analytical operations are performed. Knowledge discovery and data
mining requires complex operations on the underlying data which can be very
expensive in terms of computation time. High performance parallel systems
can reduce this analysis time.Precomputed aggregate calculations in a Data Cube can provide efficient
query processing for OLAP applications. In this article, we present
algorithms for construction of data cubes on distributed-memory parallel
computers. Data is loaded from a relational database into a
multidimensional array. We present two methods, sort-based and hash-based
for loading the base cube and compare their performances. Data cubes are
used to perform consolidation queries used in roll-up operations using
dimension hierarchies. Finally, we show how data cubes are used for data
mining using Attribute Focusing techniques. We present results for these on
the IBM-SP2 parallel machine. Results show that our algorithms and
techniques for OLAP and data mining on parallel systems are scalable to a
large number of processors, providing a high performance platform for such
applications.
