Coherence-Enhancing Diffusion Filtering.
The completion of interrupted lines or the enhancement of
flow-like structures is a challenging task in computer vision,
human vision, and image processing. We address this problem by
presenting a multiscale method in which a nonlinear diffusion
filter is steered by the so-called interest operator (second-moment
matrix, structure tensor). An m-dimensional formulation of this
method is analysed with respect to its well-posedness and scale-space
properties. An efficient scheme is presented which uses a
stabilization by a semi-implicit additive operator splitting (AOS),
and the scale-space behaviour of this method is illustrated by applying
it to both 2-D and 3-D images.
