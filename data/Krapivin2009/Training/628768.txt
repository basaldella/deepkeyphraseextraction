Thermophysical Algebraic Invariants from Infrared Imagery for Object Recognition.
AbstractAn important issue in developing a model-based vision system is the specification of features that are invariant to viewing and scene conditions and also specific, i.e., the feature must have different values for different classes of objects. We formulate a new approach for establishing invariant features. Our approach is unique in the field since it considers not just surface reflection and surface geometry in the specification of invariant features, but it also takes into account internal object composition and state which affect images sensed in the nonvisible spectrum. A new type of invariance called Thermophysical Invariance is defined. Features are defined such that they are functions of only the thermophysical properties of the imaged objects. The approach is based on a physics-based model that is derived from the principle of the conservation of energy applied at the surface of the imaged object.
