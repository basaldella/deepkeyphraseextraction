Definability of Polyadic Lifts of Generalized Quantifiers.
We study generalized quantifiers on finite structures.
With every function f :
we associate a quantifier Q_f by letting Q_fx
&phis; say there are at least f(n) elementsx
satisfying &phis;, where n is the size
of the universe. This is the general form of
what is known as a monotone quantifier of type  1 .
We study so called polyadic lifts
of such quantifiers. The particular lifts we consider
are Ramseyfication, branching and resumption.
In each case we get exact criteria for
definability of the lift in terms of simpler quantifiers.
