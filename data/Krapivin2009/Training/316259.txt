Multicategory Classification by Support Vector Machines.
We examine the problem of how to discriminate between objects
of three or more classes. Specifically, we investigate how two-class
discrimination methods can be extended to the multiclass case. We
show how the linear programming (LP) approaches based on the work of
Mangasarian and quadratic programming (QP) approaches based on
Vapniks Support Vector Machine (SVM) can be combined to yield two
new approaches to the multiclass problem. In LP multiclass
discrimination, a single linear program is used to construct a
piecewise-linear classification function. In our proposed multiclass
SVM method, a single quadratic program is used to construct a
piecewise-nonlinear classification function. Each piece of this
function can take the form of a polynomial, a radial basis function,
or even a neural network. For the k > 2-class problems, the SVM
method as originally proposed required the construction of a
two-class SVM to separate each class from the remaining classes.
Similarily, k two-class linear programs can be used for the
multiclass problem. We performed an empirical study of the original
LP method, the proposed k LP method, the proposed single QP method
and the original k QP methods. We discuss the advantages and
disadvantages of each approach.
