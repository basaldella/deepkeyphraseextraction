Communication-based prevention of useless checkpoints in distributed computations.
A useless checkpoint is a local checkpoint that cannot be part of a consistent global checkpoint. This paper addresses the following problem. Given a set of processes that take (basic) local checkpoints in an independent and unknown way, the problem is to design communication-induced checkpointing protocols that direct processes to take additional local (forced) checkpoints to ensure no local checkpoint is useless. The paper first proves two properties related to integer timestamps which are associated with each local checkpoint. The first property is a necessary and sufficient condition that these timestamps must satisfy for no checkpoint to be useless. The second property provides an easy timestamp-based determination of consistent global checkpoints. Then, a general communication-induced checkpointing protocol is proposed. This protocol, derived from the two previous properties, actually defines a family of timestamp-based communication-induced checkpointing protocols. It is shown that several existing checkpointing protocols for the same problem are particular instances of the general protocol. The design of this general protocol is motivated by the use of communication-induced checkpointing protocols in "consistent global checkpoint"-based distributed applications such as the detection of stable or unstable properties and the determination of distributed breakpoints.
