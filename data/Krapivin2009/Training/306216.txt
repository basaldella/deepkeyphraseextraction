Conjectural Equilibrium in Multiagent Learning.
Learning in a multiagent environment is complicated by the fact that
as other agents learn, the environment effectively changes. Moreover,
other agents actions are often not directly observable, and the
actions taken by the learning agent can strongly bias which range of
behaviors are encountered. We define the concept of a conjectural
equilibrium, where all agents expectations are realized, and each
agent responds optimally to its expectations. We present a generic multiagent
exchange situation, in which competitive behavior constitutes a conjectural
equilibrium. We then introduce an agent that executes a more sophisticated
strategic learning strategy, building a model of the response of other
agents. We find that the system reliably converges to a conjectural
equilibrium, but that the final result achieved is highly sensitive to
initial belief. In essence, the strategic learners actions tend to fulfill
its expectations. Depending on the starting point, the agent may be
better or worse off than had it not attempted to learn a model of the
other agents at all.
