Interactive Parallel Programming using the ParaScope Editor.
The ParaScope Editor, an intelligent interactive editor for parallel Fortran programs, which is the centerpiece of the ParaScope project, an integrated collection of tools to help scientific programmers implement correct and efficient parallel programs, is discussed. ParaScope Editor reveals to users potential hazards of a proposed parallelization in a program. It provides a variety of powerful interactive program transformations that have been shown useful in converting programs to parallel form. ParaScope Editor supports general user editing through a hybrid text and structure editing facility that incrementally analyzes the modified program for potential hazards. It is shown that ParaScope Editor supports an exploratory programming style in which users get immediate feedback on their various strategies for parallelization.
