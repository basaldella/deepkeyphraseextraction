Automatic Accurate Cost-Bound Analysis for High-Level Languages.
This paper describes a language-based approach for automatic and accurate cost-bound analysis. The approach consists of transformations for building cost-bound functions in the presence of partially known input structures, symbolic evaluation of the cost-bound function based on input size parameters, and optimizations to make the overall analysis efficient as well as accurate, all at the source-language level. The calculated cost bounds are expressed in terms of primitive cost parameters. These parameters can be obtained based on the language implementation or can be measured conservatively or approximately, yielding accurate, conservative, or approximate time or space bounds. We have implemented this approach and performed a number of experiments for analyzing Scheme programs. The results helped confirm the accuracy of the analysis.
