Using Model Trees for Classification.
Model trees, which are a type of decision tree with linear
regression functions at the leaves, form the basis of a recent successful
technique for predicting continuous numeric values. They can be applied to
classification problems by employing a standard method of transforming a
classification problem into a problem of function approximation.
Surprisingly, using this simple transformation the model tree inducerM5
, based on Quinlans M5,
generates more accurate classifiers than the state-of-the-art decision tree
learner C5.0, particularly when most of the attributes
are numeric.
