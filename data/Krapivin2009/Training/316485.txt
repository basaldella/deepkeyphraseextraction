Homotopy of Non-Modular Partitions and the Whitehouse Module.
We present a class of subposets of the partition
lattice n with the following property:
The order complex is homotopy equivalent to the order complex
of n  1, and the Sn-module
structure of the homology coincides with a recently discovered lifting
of the Sn
1-action on the homology of n  1.
This is the Whitehouse representation on Robinsons space of
fully-grown trees, and has also appeared in work of Getzler and
Kapranov, Mathieu, Hanlon and Stanley, and Babson et al.One example is the subposet Pnn
1 of the lattice of set partitions
n, obtained by removing all elements with a unique
nontrivial block. More generally, for 2  k  n
the subposet of the partition lattice
obtained by removing all elements with a unique
nontrivial block of size equal to k, and let Pnk &equals; \bigcapi &equals; 2k Qni. We show that Pnk is Cohen-Macaulay,
and that Pnk and
Qnk are both homotopy equivalent
to a wedge of spheres of dimension (n  4), with Betti number
(n  1) \!{n - k\over k}. The
posets Qnk are neither shellable nor
Cohen-Macaulay. We show that the Sn-module structure of
the homology generalises the Whitehouse module in a simple way.We also present a short proof of the well-known result that
rank-selection in a poset preserves the Cohen-Macaulay property.
