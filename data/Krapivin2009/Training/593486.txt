Effect of Data Distribution in Parallel Mining of Associations.
Association rule mining is an important new problem in data
mining. It has crucial applications in decision support and marketing
strategy. We proposed an efficient parallel algorithm for mining association
rules on a distributed share-nothing parallel system. Its
efficiency is attributed to the incorporation of two
powerful candidate set pruning techniques. The two techniques,
distributed and global prunings, are
sensitive to two data distribution characteristics: data
skewness and workload balance. The prunings are very effective
when both the skewness and balance
are high. We have implemented FPM on an IBM SP2 parallel system.
The performance studies show that FPM outperforms CD consistently, which
is a parallel version of the representative Apriori
algorithm (Agrawal and Srikant, 1994). Also, the results have
validated our observation
on the effectiveness of the two pruning techniques with respect
to the data distribution characteristics. Furthermore, it shows
that FPM has nice scalability and parallelism,
which can be tuned for different business applications.
