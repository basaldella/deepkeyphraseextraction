Ordering Constraints over Feature Trees.
Feature trees
are the formal basis for algorithms manipulating record like
structures in constraint programming, computational linguistics
and in concrete applications like software configuration management.
Feature trees model records, and constraints over feature trees
yield extensible and modular record descriptions. We introduce
the constraint system FEAT of ordering constraints
interpreted over feature trees. Under the view that feature trees
the relation \leq
corresponds to the information ordering (carries less information
than). We present two algorithms in cubic time, one for the
satisfiability problem and one for the entailment problem of
FEAT.  We show that FEAT has the independence property.
We are thus able to handle negative conjuncts via entailment
and obtain a cubic algorithm that decides the satisfiability
of conjunctions of positive and negated ordering constraints
over feature trees. Furthermore, we reduce the satisfiability
problem of Drres weak subsumption constraints to the satisfiability
problem of FEAT and improve the complexity bound for
solving weak subsumption constraints from O(n^5)
to O(n^3).
