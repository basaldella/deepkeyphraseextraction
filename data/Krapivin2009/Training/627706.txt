Time-Constrained Query Processing in CASE-DB.
AbstractCASE-DB is a real-time, single-user, relational prototype DBMS that permits the specification of strict time constraints for relational algebra queries. Given a time constrained nonaggregate relational algebra query and a fragment chain for each relation involved in the query, CASE-DB initially obtains a response to a modified version of the query and then uses an iterative query evaluation technique to successively improve and evaluate the modified version of the query. CASE-DB controls the risk of overspending the time quota at each step using a risk control technique.
