A polynomial-time approximation scheme for base station positioning in UMTS networks.
We consider the following optimization problem for UMTS networks: For a specified teletraffic demand and possible base station locations, choose positions for base stations such that

the construction costs are below a given limit,
as much teletraffic as possible is supplied,
the ongoing costs are minimal, and
the intra-cell interference in the range of each base station is low.

We prove that for a particular specification of teletraffic (the so called demand node concept), this problem has a polynomial-time approximation scheme, but cannot have a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme unless
