Explicit Solutions for Variational Problems in the Quadrant.
We study a variational problem (VP) that is related to semimartingale reflecting Brownian motions (SRBMs). Specifically, this VP appears in the large deviations analysis of the stationary distribution of SRBMs in the d-dimensional orthant Rd+. When d&equals;2, we provide an explicit analytical solution to the VP. This solution gives an appealing characterization of the optimal path to a given point in the quadrant and also provides an explicit expression for the optimal value of the VP. For each boundary of the quadrant, we construct a cone of boundary influence, which determines the nature of optimal paths in different regions of the quadrant. In addition to providing a complete solution in the 2-dimensional case, our analysis provides several results which may be used in analyzing the VP in higher dimensions and more general state spaces.
