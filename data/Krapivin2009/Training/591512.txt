Sensor-Based Control Architecture for a Car-Like Vehicle.
This paper presents a control architecture endowing a car-like
vehicle moving
in a dynamic and partially known environment with autonomous motion
capabilities. Like most recent control architectures for autonomous robot
systems, it combines three functional components: a set of basic
real-time
skills, a reactive execution mechanism and a decision module. The main
novelty of the architecture proposed lies in the introduction of a fourth
component akin to a meta-level of skills: the sensor-based
manoeuvers,
i.e., general templates that encode high-level expert human knowledge and
heuristics about how a specific motion task is to be performed. The concept
of sensor-based manoeuvers permit to reduce the planning effort required to
address a given motion task, thus improving the overall response-time of the
system, while retaining the good properties of a skill-based architecture,
i.e., robustness, flexibility and reactivity. The paper focuses on the
trajectory planning function (which is an important part of the
decision
module) and two types of sensor-based manoeuvers, trajectory following
and parallel parking, that have been implemented and successfully
tested on a real automatic car-like vehicle placed in different
situations.
