The Enumeration of Fully Commutative Elements of Coxeter Groups.
A Coxeter group element w is fully commutative if any
reduced expression for w can be obtained from any other via the
interchange of commuting generators. For example, in the symmetric group of
degree n, the number of fully commutative elements is the
nth Catalan number. The Coxeter groups with finitely many fully
commutative elements can be arranged into seven infinite families
A_n, B_n, D_n, E_n,
F_n, H_n and I_2(m). For each family,
we provide explicit generating functions for the number of fully commutative
elements and the number of fully commutative involutions; in each case, the
generating function is algebraic.
