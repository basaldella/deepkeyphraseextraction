Efficient global register allocation for minimizing energy consumption.
Data referencing during program execution can be a significant source of energy consumption especially for data-intensive programs. In this paper, we propose an approach to minimize such energy consumption by allocating data to proper registers and memory. Through careful analysis of boundary conditions between consecutive blocks, our approach efficiently handles various control structures including branches, merges and loops, and achieves the allocation results benefiting the whole program. The computational cost for solving the energy minimization allocation problem is rather low comparing with known approaches while the quality of the results are very encouraging.
