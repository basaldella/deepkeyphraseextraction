Challenges and Solutions to Adaptive Computing and Seamless Mobility over Heterogeneous Wireless Networks.
Recent years have witnessed the rapid evolution of commercially
available mobile computing environments. This has given rise
to the presence of several viable, but non-interoperable wireless networking
technologies  each targeting a niche mobility environment and providing a
distinct quality of service. The lack of a uniform set of standards, the
heterogeneity in the quality of service, and the diversity in the networking
approaches makes it difficult for a mobile computing environment to provide
seamless mobility across different wireless networks. Besides, inter-network
mobility will typically be accompanied by a change in the quality of service.
The application and the environment need to collaboratively adapt their
communication and data management strategies in order to gracefully react
to the dynamic operating conditions.This paper presents the important challenges in building a mobile
computing environment which provides seamless mobility and adaptive
computing over commercially available wireless networks. It suggests
possible solutions to the challenges, and describes an ongoing research
effort to build such a mobile computing environment.
