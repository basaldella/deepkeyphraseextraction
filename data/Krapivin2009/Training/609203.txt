Certifying Compilation and Run-Time Code Generation.
A certifying compiler takes a source language program and produces
object code, as well as a certificate that can be used to verify
that the object code satisfies desirable properties, such as type
safety and memory safety. Certifying compilation helps to increase
both compiler robustness and program safety. Compiler robustness is
improved since some compiler errors can be caught by checking the
object code against the certificate immediately after compilation.
Program safety is improved because the object code and certificate
alone are sufficient to establish safety: even if the object code and
certificate are produced on an unknown machine by an unknown compiler
and sent over an untrusted network, safe execution is guaranteed as
long as the code and certificate pass the verifier.Existing work in certifying compilation has addressed statically
generated code. In this paper, we extend this to code generated at
run time. Our goal is to combine certifying compilation with run-time
code generation to produce programs that are both fast and verifiably
safe. To achieve this goal, we present two new languages with
explicit run-time code generation constructs: Cyclone, a type safe
dialect of C, and TAL/T, a type safe assembly language. We have
designed and implemented a system that translates a safe C program
into Cyclone, which is then compiled to TAL/T, and finally assembled
into executable object code. This paper focuses on our overall
approach and the front end of our system&semi; details about TAL/T will
appear in a subsequent paper.
