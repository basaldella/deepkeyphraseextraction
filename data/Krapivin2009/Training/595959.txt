On Automating Diagrammatic Proofs of Arithmetic Arguments.
Theorems in automated theorem proving are usually proved by formal
logical proofs. However, there is a subset of problems which humans can
prove by the use of geometric operations on diagrams, so called
diagrammatic proofs. Insight is often more clearly perceived in these
proofs than in the corresponding algebraic proofs; they capture an
intuitive notion of truthfulness that humans find easy to see and
understand. We are investigating and automating such diagrammatic
reasoning about mathematical theorems. Concrete, rather than general
diagrams are used to prove particular concrete instances of the
universally quantified theorem. The diagrammatic proof is captured by
the use of geometric operations on the diagram. These operations are
the inference steps of the proof. An abstracted schematic proof of
the universally quantified theorem is induced from these proof
instances. The constructive -rule provides the mathematical
basis for this step from schematic proofs to theoremhood. In this way
we avoid the difficulty of treating a general case in a diagram. One
method of confirming that the abstraction of the schematic proof from
the proof instances is sound is proving the correctness of schematic
proofs in the meta-theory of diagrams. These ideas have been
implemented in the system, called Diamond, which is presented here.
