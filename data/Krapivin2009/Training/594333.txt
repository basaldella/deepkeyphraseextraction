Alternative Translation Techniques for Propositional and First-Order Modal Logics.
We describe and analyze techniques, other than the standard relational/functional methods, for translating validity problems of modal logics into first-order languages. For propositional modal logics we summarize the &squ;-as-Pow method, a complete and automatic translation into a weak set theory, and then describe an alternative method, which we call i>algebraic, that achieves the same full generality of &squ;-as-Pow but is simpler and computationally more attractive. We also discuss the relationships between the two methods, showing that &squ;-as-Pow generalizes to the first-order case. For first-order modal logics, we describe two extensions, of different degrees of generality, of &squ;-as-Pow to logics of rigid designators and constant domains.
