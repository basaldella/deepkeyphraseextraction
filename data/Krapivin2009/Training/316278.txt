Stabilized Sequential Quadratic Programming.
Recently, Wright proposed a stabilized sequential
quadratic programming algorithm for inequality constrained optimization.
Assuming the Mangasarian-Fromovitz constraint qualification and
the existence of a strictly positive multiplier
(but possibly dependent constraint gradients), he proved a local
quadratic convergence result. In this paper, we establish quadratic
convergence in cases where
both strict complementarity and the
Mangasarian-Fromovitz constraint qualification do not hold.
The constraints on the stabilization parameter are relaxed, and linear
convergence is demonstrated when the parameter is kept fixed.
We show that the analysis of this method can be carried out using
recent results for the stability of variational problems.
