Algebraic Foundations and Broadcasting Algorithms for Wormhole-Routed All-Port Tori.
AbstractThe one-to-all broadcast is the most primary collective communication pattern in a multicomputer network. We consider this problem in a wormhole-routed torus which uses the all-port and dimension-ordered routing model. We derive our routing algorithms based on the concept of span of vector spaces in linear algebra. For instance, in a 3D torus, the nodes receiving the broadcast message will be spanned from the source node to a line of nodes, to a plane of nodes, and then to a cube of nodes. Our results require at most $2(k-1)$ steps more than the optimal number of steps for any square $k$-D torus. Existing results, as compared to ours, can only be applied to tori of very restricted dimensions or sizes and either rely on an undesirable non-dimension-ordered routing or require more numbers of steps.
