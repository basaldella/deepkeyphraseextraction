An Implementation of Constructive Synchronous Programs in POLIS.
Design tools for embedded reactive systems commonly use a model of computation that employs both synchronous and asynchronous communication styles. We form a junction between these two with an implementation of synchronous languages and circuits (Esterel) on asynchronous networks (POLIS). We implement fact propagation, the key concept of synchronous constructive semantics, on an asynchronous non-deterministic network: POLIS nodes (CFSMs) save state locally to deduce facts, and the network globally propagates facts between them. The result is a correct implementation of the synchronous input/output behavior of the program. Our model is compositional, and thus permits implementations at various levels of granularity from one CFSM per circuit gate to one CFSM per circuit. This allows one to explore various tradeoffs between synchronous and asynchronous implementations.
