Spatial Color Indexing and Applications.
We define a new image feature called the color correlogram
and use it for image indexing and comparison. This feature distills the
spatial correlation of colors and when computed efficiently, turns
out to be both effective and inexpensive for content-based image
retrieval. The correlogram is robust in tolerating large changes
in appearance and shape caused by changes in viewing position,
camera zoom, etc. Experimental evidence shows that this new
feature outperforms not only the traditional color histogram method
but also the recently proposed histogram refinement methods
for image indexing/retrieval. We also provide a technique to
cut down the storage requirement of the correlogram so that
it is the same as that of histograms, with only negligible
performance penalty compared to the original correlogram.We also suggest the use of color correlogram as a generic
indexing tool to tackle various problems arising from image retrieval
and video browsing. We adapt the correlogram to handle the
problems of image subregion querying, object localization, object
tracking, and cut detection. Experimental results again suggest
that the color correlogram is more effective than the histogram
for these applications, with insignificant additional
storage or processing cost.
