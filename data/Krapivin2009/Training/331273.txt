Stereo Matching with Transparency and Matting.
This paper formulates and solves a new variant of the stereo
correspondence problem: simultaneously recovering the disparities,
true colors, and opacities of visible surface elements. This problem
arises in newer applications of stereo reconstruction, such as view
interpolation and the layering of real imagery with synthetic graphics
for special effects and virtual studio applications. While this problem
is intrinsically more difficult than traditional stereo correspondence,
where only the disparities are being recovered, it provides a principled
way of dealing with commonly occurring problems such as occlusions and
the handling of mixed (foreground/background) pixels near depth
discontinuities. It also provides a novel means for separating
foreground and background objects (matting), without the use of a special
blue screen. We formulate the problem as the recovery of colors and
opacities in a generalized 3D (x, y, d) disparity
space, and solve the
problem using a combination of initial evidence aggregation followed by
iterative energy minimization.
