Affine Structure and Motion from Points, Lines and Conics.
In this paper several new methods for estimating scene
structure and camera motion from an image sequence taken by affine
cameras are presented. All methods can incorporate both point, line
and conic features in a unified manner. The correspondence between
features in different images is assumed to be known.Three new
tensor representations are introduced describing the viewing geometry
for two and three cameras. The centred affine epipoles can be used to
constrain the location of corresponding points and conics in two
images. The third order, or alternatively, the reduced third order
centred affine tensors can be used to constrain the locations of
corresponding points, lines and conics in three images. The reduced
third order tensors contain only 12 components compared to the
components obtained when reducing the trifocal tensor to affine
cameras.A new factorization method is presented. The novelty
lies in the ability to handle not only point features, but also line
and conic features concurrently. Another complementary method based
on the so-called closure constraints is also presented. The advantage
of this method is the ability to handle missing data in a simple and
uniform manner.  Finally, experiments performed on both simulated and
real data are given, including a comparison with other
methods.
