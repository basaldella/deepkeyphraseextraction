On-the-Fly Model Checking Under Fairness that Exploits Symmetry.
An on-the-fly algorithm for model checking under fairness is
presented. The algorithm utilizes symmetry in the program to
reduce the state space, and employs novel techniques that make the
on-the-fly model checking feasible. The algorithm uses state symmetry and
eliminates parallel edges in the reachability graph. Experimental results
demonstrating dramatic reductions in both the running time and memory
usage are presented.
