Nitsche type mortaring for some elliptic problem with corner singularities.
The paper deals with Nitsche type mortaring as a finite element method (FEM) for treating non-matching meshes of triangles at the interface of some domain decomposition. The approach is applied to the Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions (as a model problem) under the aspect that the interface passes re-entrant corners of the domain. For such problems and non-matching meshes with and without local refinement near the re-entrant corner, some properties of the finite element scheme and error estimates are proved. They show that appropriate mesh grading yields convergence rates as known for the classical FEM in presence of regular solutions. Finally, a numerical example illustrates the approach and the theoretical results.
