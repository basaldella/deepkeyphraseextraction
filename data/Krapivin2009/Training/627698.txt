A Graph-Based Data Model and its Ramifications.
AbstractCurrently, database researchers are investigating new data models in order to remedy the deficiences of the flat relational model when applied to nonbusiness applications. Herein we concentrate on a recent graph-based data model called the hypernode model. The single underlying data structure of this model is the hypernode which is a digraph with a unique defining label. We present in detail the three components of the model, namely its data structure, the hypernode, its query and update language, called HNQL, and its provision for enforcing integrity constraints. We first demonstrate that the said data model is a natural candidate for formalising hypertext. We then compare it with other graph-based data models and with set-based data models. We also investigate the expressive power of HNQL. Finally, using the hypernode model as a paradigm for graph-based data modelling, we show how to bridge the gap between graph-based and set-based data models, and at what computational cost this can be done.
