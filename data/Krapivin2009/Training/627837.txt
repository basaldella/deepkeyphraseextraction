Reusing Analogous Components.
AbstractUsing formal specifications to represent software components facilitates the determination of reusability because they more precisely characterize the functionality of the software, and the well-defined syntax makes processing amenable to automation. This paper presents an approach, based on formal methods, to the search, retrieval, and modification of reusable software components. From a two-tiered hierarchy of reusable software components, the existing components that are analogous to the query specification are retrieved from the hierarchy. The specification for an analogous retrieved component is compared to the query specification to determine what changes need to be applied to the corresponding program component in order to make it satisfy the query specification.
