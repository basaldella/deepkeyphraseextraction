Automated techniques for provably safe mobile code.
We present a general framework for provably safe mobile code. It relies on a formal definition of a safety policy and explicit evidence for compliance with this policy which is attached to a binary. Concrete realizations of this framework are proof-carrying code, where the evidence for safety is a formal proof generated by a certifying compiler, and typed assembly language, where the evidence for safety is given via type annotations propagated throughout the compilation process in typed intermediate languages. Validity of the evidence is established via a small trusted type checker, either directly on the binary or indirectly on proof representations in a logical framework.
