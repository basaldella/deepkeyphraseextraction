A Syntactic Theory of Dynamic Binding.
Dynamic binding, which traditionally has always been associated with
Lisp, is still semantically obscure to many. Even though most programming
languages favour lexical scope, not only does dynamic binding remain an
interesting and expressive programming technique in specialised circumstances,
but also it is a key notion in formal semantics. This article presents a
syntactic theory that enables the programmer to perform equational reasoning on
programs using dynamic binding. The theory is proved to be sound and complete
with respect to derivations allowed on programs in dynamic-environment
passing style. From this theory, we derive a sequential
evaluation function
in a context-rewriting system. Then, we further refine the evaluation function
in two popular implementation strategies: deep binding and
shallow binding with
value cells. Afterwards, following the saying that deep binding is suitable
for parallel evaluation, we present the parallel evaluation function of a
future-based functional language extended with constructs for dynamic binding.
Finally, we exhibit the power and usefulness of dynamic binding in two
different ways. First, we prove that dynamic binding adds expressiveness to a
purely functional language. Second, we show that dynamic binding is an
essential notion in semantics that can be used to define exceptions.
