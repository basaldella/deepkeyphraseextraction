Orthogonal Matroids.
The notion of matroid has been generalized to Coxeter matroid by Gelfand and Serganova. To each pair i>(W, P) consisting of a finite irreducible Coxeter group i>W and parabolic subgroup i>P is associated a collection of objects called Coxeter matroids. The (ordinary) matroids are the special case where i>W is the symmetric group (the i>An case) and i>P is a maximal parabolic subgroup.This generalization of matroid introduces interesting combinatorial structures corresponding to each of the finite Coxeter groups. Borovik, Gelfand and White began an investigation of the i>Bn case, called symplectic matroids. This paper initiates the study of the i>Dn case, called orthogonal matroids. The main result (Theorem 2) gives three characterizations of orthogonal matroid: algebraic, geometric, and combinatorial. This result relies on a combinatorial description of the Bruhat order on i>Dn (Theorem 1). The representation of orthogonal matroids by way of totally isotropic subspaces of a classical orthogonal space (Theorem 5) justifies the terminology i>orthogonal matroid.
