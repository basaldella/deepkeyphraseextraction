Representing the zoo world and the traffic world in the language of the causal calculator.
The work described in this report is motivated by the desire to test the expressive possibilities of action language C+. The Causal Calculator (CCALC) is a system that answers queries about action domains described in a fragment of that language. The Zoo World and the Traffic World have been proposed by Erik Sandewall in his Logic Modelling Workshop--an environment for communicating axiomatizations of action domains of nontrivial size.The Zoo World consists of several cages and the exterior, gates between them, and animals of several species, including humans. Actions in this domain include moving within and between cages, opening and closing gates, and mounting and riding animals. The Traffic World includes vehicles moving continuously between road crossings subject to a number of restrictions, such as speed limits and keeping a fixed safety distance away from other vehicles on the road. We show how to represent the two domains in the input language of CCALC, and how to use CCALC to test these representations.
