Deterministic Built-in Pattern Generation for Sequential Circuits.
We present a new pattern generation approach for
deterministic built-in self testing (BIST) of sequential circuits.
Our approach is based on precomputed test sequences, and is
especially suited to sequential circuits that contain a large number
of flip-flops but relatively few controllable primary inputs. Such
circuits, often encountered as embedded cores and as filters for
digital signal processing, are difficult to test and require long
test sequences. We show that statistical encoding of precomputed
test sequences can be combined with low-cost pattern decoding to
provide deterministic BIST with practical levels of overhead. Optimal
Huffman codes and near-optimal Comma codes are especially useful
for test set encoding. This approach exploits recent advances in
automatic test pattern generation for sequential circuits and, unlike
other BIST schemes, does not require access to a gate-level model of
the circuit under test. It can be easily automated and integrated
with design automation tools. Experimental results for the ISCAS 89
benchmark circuits show that the proposed method provides higher
fault coverage than pseudorandom testing with shorter test
application time and low to moderate hardware overhead.
