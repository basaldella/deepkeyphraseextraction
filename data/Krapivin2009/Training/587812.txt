Approximation of the Determinant of Large Sparse Symmetric Positive Definite Matrices.
This paper is concerned with the  problem of approximating det(A)1/n for a large sparse symmetric positive definite matrix A of order n. It is shown that an efficient solution of this problem is obtained  by using a sparse approximate inverse of A. The method is explained and theoretical properties are discussed. The method is ideal for implementation on a parallel computer. Numerical experiments are described  that illustrate the performance of this new method and provide a comparison with Monte Carlo--type  methods from the literature.
