A Theory-Based Representation for Object-Oriented Domain Models.
AbstractFormal software specification has long been touted as a way to increase the quality and reliability of software; however, it remains an intricate, manually intensive activity. An alternative to using formal specifications directly is to translate graphically based, semiformal specifications into formal specifications. However, before this translation can take place, a formal definition of basic object-oriented concepts must be found. This paper presents an algebraic model of object-orientation that defines how object-oriented concepts can be represented algebraically using an object-oriented algebraic specification language O-Slang. O-Slang combines basic algebraic specification constructs with category theory operations to capture internal object class structure, as well as relationships between classes.
