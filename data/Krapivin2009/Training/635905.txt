An efficient direct solver for the boundary concentrated FEM in 2D.
The boundary concentrated FEM, a variant of the hp-version of the finite element method, is proposed for the numerical treatment of elliptic boundary value problems. It is particularly suited for equations with smooth coefficients and non-smooth boundary conditions. In the two-dimensional case it is shown that the Cholesky factorization of the resulting stiffness matrix requires O(Nlog4N) units of storage and can be computed with O(Nlog8N) work, where N denotes the problem size. Numerical results confirm theoretical estimates.
