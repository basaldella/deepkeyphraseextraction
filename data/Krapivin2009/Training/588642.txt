Smoothing Methods and Semismooth Methods for Nondifferentiable Operator Equations.
We consider superlinearly convergent analogues of Newton methods for nondifferentiable operator equations in function spaces. The superlinear convergence analysis of semismooth methods for nondifferentiable equations described by a locally Lipschitzian operator in Rn is based on Rademacher's theorem which does not hold in function spaces. We introduce a concept of slant differentiability and use it to study  superlinear convergence of smoothing methods and semismooth methods in a unified framework. We show that a function is slantly differentiable at a point if and only if it is Lipschitz continuous at that point. An application to the  Dirichlet problems for a simple class of nonsmooth elliptic partial differential equations is discussed.
