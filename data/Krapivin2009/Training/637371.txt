New Interval Analysis Support Functions Using Gradient Information in a Global Minimization Algorithm.
The performance of interval analysis branch-and-bound global optimization algorithms strongly depends on the efficiency of selection, bounding, elimination, division, and termination rules used in their implementation. All the information obtained during the search process has to be taken into account in order to increase algorithm efficiency, mainly when this information can be obtained and elaborated without additional cost (in comparison with traditional approaches). In this paper a new way to calculate interval analysis support functions for multiextremal univariate functions is presented. The new support functions are based on obtaining the same kind of information used in interval analysis global optimization algorithms. The new support functions enable us to develop more powerful bounding, selection, and rejection criteria and, as a consequence, to significantly accelerate the search. Numerical comparisons made on a wide set of multiextremal test functions have shown that on average the new algorithm works almost two times faster than a traditional interval analysis global optimization method.
