Efficient Implementations of Software Architectures via Partial Evaluation.
The notion of flexibility (that is, the ability to adapt to
changing requirements or execution contexts) is recognized as a key
concern in structuring software, and many architectures have been
designed to that effect. However, the corresponding implementations
often come with performance and code size overheads. The source of
inefficiency can be identified to be in the loose integration of
components, because flexibility is often present not only at the
design level but also in the implementation. To solve this flexibility
vs. efficiency dilemma, we advocate the
use of partial evaluation, which is an automated technique to produce
efficient, specialized instances of generic programs. As supporting
case studies, we consider several flexible mechanisms commonly found
in software architectures: selective broadcast, pattern matching,
interpreters, software layers, and generic libraries. Using Tempo,
our specializer for C, we show how partial evaluation can safely
optimize implementations of those mechanisms. Because this
optimization is automatic, it preserves the original genericity and
extensibility of the implementation.
