A Methodological View of Constraint Solving.
Constraints are an effective tool
to define sets of data by means of logical formulae. Our goal
here is to survey the notion of constraint system and to give
examples of constraint systems operating on various domains,
such as natural, rational or real numbers, finite domains, and
term domains. We classify the different methods used for solving
constraints, syntactic methods based on transformations, semantic
methods based on adequate representations of constraints, hybrid
methods combining transformations and enumerations. The concepts
and methods are illustrated via examples. We also discuss applications
of constraints to various fields, such as programming, operations
research, and theorem proving.
