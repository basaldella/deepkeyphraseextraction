Verifying lossy channel systems has nonprimitive recursive complexity.
Lossy channel systems are systems of finite state automata that communicate via unreliable unbounded fifo channels. It is known that reachability, termination and a few other verification problems are decidable for these systems. In this article we show that these problems cannot be solved in primitive recursive time.
