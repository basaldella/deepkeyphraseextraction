Explanation-Based Scenario Generation for Reactive System Models.
Reactive systems control many useful and complex real-world devices. Tool-supported specification modeling helps software engineers design such systems correctly. One such tool, a scenario generator, constructs an input event sequence for the spec model that reaches a state satisfying given criteria. It can uncover counterexamples to desired safety properties, explain feature interactions in concrete terms to requirements analysts, and even provide online help to end users learning how to use a system. However, while exhaustive search algorithms such as model checkers work in limited cases, the problem is highly intractable for the functionally rich models that correspond naturally to complex systems engineers wish to design. This paper describes a novel heuristic approach to the problem that is applicable to a large class of infinite state reactive systems. The key idea is to piece together scenarios that achieve subgoals into a single scenario achieving the conjunction of the subgoals. The scenarios are mined from a library captured independently during requirements acquisition. Explanation-based generalization then abstracts them so they may be coinstantiated and interleaved. The approach is implemented, and I present the results of applying the tool to 63 scenario generation problems arising from a case study of telephony feature validation.
