A Framework for Integrating Data Alignment, Distribution, and Redistribution in Distributed Memory Multiprocessors.
AbstractParallel architectures with physically distributed memory provide a cost-effective scalability to solve many large scale scientific problems. However, these systems are very difficult to program and tune. In these systems, the choice of a good data mapping and parallelization strategy can dramatically improve the efficiency of the resulting program. In this paper, we present a framework for automatic data mapping in the context of distributed memory multiprocessor systems. The framework is based on a new approach that allows the alignment, distribution, and redistribution problems to be solved together using a single graph representation. The Communication Parallelism Graph (CPG) is the structure that holds symbolic information about the potential data movement and parallelism inherent to the whole program. The CPG is then particularized for a given problem size and target system and used to find a minimal cost path through the graph using a general purpose linear 0-1 integer programming solver. The data layout strategy generated is optimal according to our current cost and compilation models.
