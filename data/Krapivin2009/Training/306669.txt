A Behavior Model for Next Generation Test Systems.
Defining information required by automatic test systems frequently
involves a description of system behavior. To facilitate capturing the
required behavior information in the context of testing, a formal model of
behavior was developed for use by test systems. The approach taken in
defining the behavior model was based on information modeling and was
derived from recent work in formal methods by the hardware and software
design communities. Specifically, an information model was developed in
EXPRESS capturing the relationships between essential entities characterizing
behavior. In this paper, we provide a high level description of the behavior
information model and several examples applying the model in a test
environment.
