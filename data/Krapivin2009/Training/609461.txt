Adaptive Modulation over Nakagami Fading Channels.
We first study the capacity of Nakagami multipath fading (NMF) channels

with an average power constraint for three power and rate adaptation

policies. We obtain closed-form solutions for NMF

channel capacity for each power and rate adaptation strategy.

Results show that rate adaptation is the key to increasing

link spectral efficiency.

We then analyze

the performance of practical constant-power variable-rate M-QAM schemes

over NMF channels. We obtain closed-form

expressions for the outage probability, spectral efficiency and

average bit-error-rate (BER) assuming perfect channel

estimation and negligible time delay between channel estimation

and signal set adaptation. We also

analyze the impact of time delay on the BER of adaptive M-QAM.
