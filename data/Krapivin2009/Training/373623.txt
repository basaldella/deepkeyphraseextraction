Customer Retention via Data Mining.
``Customer Retention'' is an increasingly pressing issue in

today's ever-competitive commercial arena. This is especially relevant

and important for sales and services related industries. Motivated by a

real-world problem faced by a large company, we proposed a solution that

integrates various techniques of data mining, such as feature

selection via induction, deviation analysis, and mining multiple

concept-level association rules to form an intuitive and novel approach

to gauging customer loyalty and predicting their likelihood of

defection. Immediate action triggered by these ``early-warnings''

resulting from data mining is often the key to eventual customer

retention.
