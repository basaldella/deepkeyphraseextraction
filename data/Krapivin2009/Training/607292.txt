Jacobi Polynomials, Type II Codes, and Designs.
Jacobi polynomials were introduced by
Ozeki in analogy with Jacobi forms of lattices. They are useful
to compute coset weight enumerators, and weight enumerators of
children. We determine them in most interesting cases in length
at most 32, and in some cases in length 72.
We use them to construct group divisible designs, packing designs,
covering designs, and (t,r)-designs in the sense
of Calderbank-Delsarte. A major tool is invariant theory of finite
groups, in particular simultaneous invariants in the sense of
Schur, polarization, and bivariate Molien series. A combinatorial
interpretation of the Aronhold polarization operator is given.
New rank parameters for spaces of coset weight distributions
and Jacobi polynomials are introduced and studied here.
