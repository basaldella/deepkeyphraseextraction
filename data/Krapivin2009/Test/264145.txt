Software Reuse by Specialization of Generic Procedures through Views.
AbstractA generic procedure can be specialized, by compilation through views, to operate directly on concrete data. A view is a computational mapping that describes how a concrete type implements an abstract type. Clusters of related views are needed for specialization of generic procedures that involve several types or several views of a single type. A user interface that reasons about relationships between concrete types and abstract types allows view clusters to be created easily. These techniques allow rapid specialization of generic procedures for applications.
