A Volumetric/Iconic Frequency Domain Representation for Objects With Application for Pose Invariant Face Recognition.
AbstractA novel method for representing 3D objects that unifies viewer and model centered object representations is presented. A unified 3D frequency-domain representation (called Volumetric Frequency RepresentationVFR) encapsulates both the spatial structure of the object and a continuum of its views in the same data structure. The frequency-domain image of an object viewed from any direction can be directly extracted employing an extension of the Projection Slice Theorem, where each Fourier-transformed view is a planar slice of the volumetric frequency representation. The VFR is employed for pose-invariant recognition of complex objects, such as faces. The recognition and pose estimation is based on an efficient matching algorithm in a four-dimensional Fourier space. Experimental examples of pose estimation and recognition of faces in various poses are also presented.
