Effective erasure codes for reliable computer communication protocols.
Reliable communication protocols require that all the intended recipients of a message receive the message intact. Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) techniques are used in unicast protocols, but they do not scale well to multicast protocols with large groups of receivers, since segment losses tend to become uncorrelated thus greatly reducing the effectiveness of retransmissions. In such cases, Forward Error Correction (FEC) techniques can be used, consisting in the transmission of redundant packets (based on error correcting codes) to allow the receivers to recover from independent packet losses.Despite the widespread use of error correcting codes in many fields of information processing, and a general consensus on the usefulness of FEC techniques within some of the Internet protocols, very few actual implementations exist of the latter. This probably derives from the different types of applications, and from concerns related to the complexity of implementing such codes in software. To fill this gap, in this paper we provide a very basic description of erasure codes, describe an implementation of a simple but very flexible erasure code to be used in network protocols, and discuss its performance and possible applications. Our code is based on Vandermonde matrices computed over GF(pr), can be implemented very efficiently on common microprocessors, and is suited to a number of different applications, which are briefly discussed in the paper. An implementation of the erasure code shown in this paper is available from the author, and is able to encode/decode data at speeds up to several MB/s running on a Pentium 133.
