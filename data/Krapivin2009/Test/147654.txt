Programming and Verifying Real-Time Systems by Means of the Synchronous Data-Flow Language LUSTRE.
The benefits of using a synchronous data-flow language for programming critical real-time systems are investigated. These benefits concern ergonomy (since the dataflow approach meets traditional description tools used in this domain) and ability to support formal design and verification methods. It is shown, using a simple example, how the language LUSTRE and its associated verification tool LESAR, can be used to design a program, to specify its critical properties, and to verify these properties. As the language LUSTRE and its uses have already been discussed in several papers, emphasis is put on program verification.
