Back and forth between guarded and modal logics.
Guarded fixed-point logic GF extends the guarded fragment by means of least and greatest fixed points, and thus plays the same role within the domain of guarded logics as the modal -calculus plays within the modal domain. We provide a semantic characterization of GF within an appropriate fragment of second-order logic, in terms of invariance under guarded bisimulation. The corresponding characterization of the modal -calculus, due to Janin and Walukiewicz, is lifted from the modal to the guarded domain by means of model theoretic translations. Guarded second-order logic, the fragment of second-order logic which is introduced in the context of our characterization theorem, captures a natural and robust level of expressiveness with several equivalent characterizations. For a wide range of issues in guarded logics it may take up a role similar to that of monadic second-order in relation to modal logics. At the more general methodological level, the translations between the guarded and modal domains make the intuitive analogy between guarded and modal logics available as a tool in the further analysis of the model theory of guarded logics.
