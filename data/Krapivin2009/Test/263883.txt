Possibilities of using protocol converters for NIR system construction.
Volumes of information available from network information services have been increasing considerably in recent years. Users' satisfaction with an information service depends very much on the quality of the network information retrieval (NIR) system used to retrieve information. The construction of such a system involves two major development areas: user interface design and the implementation of NIR protocols.In this paper we describe and discuss the possibilities of using formal methods of protocol converter design to construct the part of an NIR system client that deals with network communication. If this approach is practicable it can make implementation of NIR protocols more reliable and amenable to automation than traditional designs using general purpose programming languages. This will enable easy implementation of new NIR protocols custom-tailored to specialized NIR services, while the user interface remains the same for all these services.Based on a simple example of implementing the Gopher protocol client we conclude that the known formal methods of protocol converter design are generally not directly applicable for our approach. However, they could be used under certain circumstances when supplemented with other techniques which we propose in the discussion.
