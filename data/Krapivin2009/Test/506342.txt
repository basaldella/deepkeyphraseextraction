Strong normalizability of the non-deterministic catch/throw calculi.
The catch/throw mechanism in Common Lisp provides a simple control
mechanism for non-local exits. We study typed calculi by Nakano and
Sato which formalize the catch/throw mechanism. These calculi
correspond to classical logic through the Curry-Howard isomorphism,
and one of their characteristic points is that they have
non-deterministic reduction rules. These calculi can represent
various computational meaning of classical proofs. This paper is
mainly concerned with the strong normalizability of these calculi.
Namely, we prove the strong normalizability of these calculi, which
was an open problem. We first formulate a non-deterministic variant
of Parigot's -calculus, and show it is strongly
normalizing. We then translate the catch/throw calculi to this
variant. Since the translation preserves typing and reduction, we
obtain the strong normalization of the catch/throw calculi. We also
briefly consider second-order extension of the catch/throw calculi.
