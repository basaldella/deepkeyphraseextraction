Decidability of EDT0L structural equivalence.
We show that a tree pushdown automaton can verify, for an arbitrary nondeterministically constructed structure tree t, that t does not correspond to any valid derivation of a given EDT0L grammar. In this way we reduce the structural equivalence problem for EDT0L grammars to deciding emptiness of the tree language recognized by a tree pushdown automaton, i.e., to the emptiness problem for context-free tree languages. Thus we establish that structural equivalence for EDT0L grammars can be decided effectively. The result contrasts the known undecidability result for ET0L structural equivalence.
