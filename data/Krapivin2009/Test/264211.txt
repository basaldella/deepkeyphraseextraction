Trading conflict and capacity aliasing in conditional branch predictors.
As modern microprocessors employ deeper pipelines and issue multiple instructions per cycle, they are becoming increasingly dependent on accurate branch prediction. Because hardware resources for branch-predictor tables are invariably limited, it is not possible to hold all relevant branch history for all active branches at the same time, especially for large workloads consisting of multiple processes and operating-system code. The problem that results, commonly referred to as aliasing in the branch-predictor tables, is in many ways similar to the misses that occur in finite-sized hardware caches.In this paper we propose a new classification for branch aliasing based on the three-Cs model for caches, and show that conflict aliasing is a significant source of mispredictions. Unfortunately, the obvious method for removing conflicts --- adding tags and associativity to the predictor tables --- is not a cost-effective solution.To address this problem, we propose the skewed branch predictor, a multi-bank, tag-less branch predictor, designed specifically to reduce the impact of conflict aliasing. Through both analytical and simulation models, we show that the skewed branch predictor removes a substantial portion of conflict aliasing by introducing redundancy to the branch-predictor tables. Although this redundancy increases capacity aliasing compared to a standard one-bank structure of comparable size, our simulations show that the reduction in conflict aliasing overcomes this effect to yield a gain in prediction accuracy. Alternatively, we show that a skewed organization can achieve the same prediction accuracy as a standard one-bank organization but with half the storage requirements.
