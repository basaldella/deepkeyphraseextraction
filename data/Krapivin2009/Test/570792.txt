Providing stochastic delay guarantees through channel characteristics based resource reservation in wireless network.
This paper is directed towards providing quality of service guarantees for transmission of multimedia traffic over wireless links. The quality of service guarantees require transmission of packets within prespecified deadlines. Oftentimes, bursty, location dependent channel errors preclude such deadline satisfaction leading to packet drop. Wireless systems need resource reservation to limit such deadline violation related packet drop below acceptable thresholds. The resource reservation depends on the scheduling policy, statistical channel qualities and arrival traffic. We choose Earliest Deadline First as the baseline scheduling policy and design an admission control strategy which provides delay guarantees and limits the packet drop by regulating the number of admitted sessions in accordance with the long term transmission characteristics and arrival traffic of the incoming sessions. We analytically quantify the stochastic packet drop guarantees provided by the framework, and show using simulation that the design results in low packet drop.
