Strategies in Combined Learning via Logic Programs.
We discuss the adoption of a three-valued setting for
inductive concept learning. Distinguishing between what is true, what
is false and what is unknown can be useful in situations where
decisions have to be taken on the basis of scarce, ambiguous, or
downright contradictory information. In a three-valued setting, we
learn a definition for both the target concept and its opposite,
considering positive and negative examples as instances of two
disjoint classes. To this purpose, we adopt Extended Logic Programs
(ELP) under a Well-Founded Semantics with explicit negation
(WFSX) as the representation formalism for learning, and show how
ELPs can be used to specify combinations of strategies in a
declarative way also coping with contradiction and exceptions.Explicit negation is used to represent the opposite concept,
while default negation is used to ensure consistency and to
handle exceptions to general rules. Exceptions are represented
by examples covered by the definition for a concept that belong
to the training set for the opposite concept.Standard Inductive Logic Programming techniques are employed to
learn the concept and its opposite. Depending on the adopted
technique, we can learn the most general or the least general
definition. Thus, four epistemological varieties occur,
resulting from the combination of most general and least general
solutions for the positive and negative concept. We discuss the
factors that should be taken into account when choosing and
strategically combining the generality levels for positive and
negative concepts.In the paper, we also handle the issue of strategic combination
of possibly contradictory learnt definitions of a predicate and
its explicit negation.All in all, we show that extended logic programs under
well-founded semantics with explicit negation add expressivity
to learning tasks, and allow the tackling of a number of
representation and strategic issues in a principled way.Our techniques have been implemented and examples run on a
state-of-the-art logic programming system with tabling which
implements WFSX.
