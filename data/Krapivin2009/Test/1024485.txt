Typing constraint logic programs.
We present a prescriptive type system with parametric polymorphism and subtyping for constraint logic programs. The aim of this type system is to detect programming errors statically. It introduces a type discipline for constraint logic programs and modules, while maintaining the capabilities of performing the usual coercions between constraint domains, and of typing meta-programming predicates, thanks to the exibility of subtyping. The property of subject reduction expresses the consistency of a prescriptive type system w.r.t. the execution model: if a program is well-typed, then all derivations starting from a well-typed goal are again well-typed. That property is proved w.r.t. the abstract execution model of constraint programming which proceeds by accumulation of constraints only, and w.r.t. an enriched execution model with type constraints for substitutions. We describe our implementation of the system for type checking and type inference. We report our experimental results on type checking ISO-Prolog, the (constraint) libraries of Sicstus Prolog and other Prolog programs.
