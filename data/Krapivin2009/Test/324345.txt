ARMADA Middleware and Communication Services.
Real-time embedded systems have evolved during the past
several decades from small custom-designed digital hardware to
large distributed processing systems. As these systems
become more complex,
their interoperability, evolvability and cost-effectiveness
requirements motivate the use of commercial-off-the-shelf
components. This raises the challenge of
constructing dependable and predictable real-time services
for application developers on top of the inexpensive hardware and
software components which has minimal support for timeliness and
dependability guarantees.
We are addressing this challenge in the ARMADA project.ARMADA is set of communication and middleware services that provide
support for fault-tolerance and end-to-end guarantees for
embedded real-time distributed applications.
Since real-time performance of such applications depends heavily
on the communication subsystem, the first thrust of the project is to
develop a predictable communication service and architecture to ensure
QoS-sensitive message delivery.
Fault-tolerance is of paramount importance to embedded
safety-critical systems. In its second thrust,
ARMADA aims to offload the complexity of
developing fault-tolerant applications from the
application programmer by focusing on a collection of
modular, composable middleware for fault-tolerant group
communication and replication under timing constraints.
Finally, we develop tools for testing and validating the
behavior of our services. We give an overview of the ARMADA
project, describing the architecture and
presenting its implementation status.
