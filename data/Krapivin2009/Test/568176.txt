Search-based binding time analysis using type-directed pruning.
We introduce a new way of performing binding time analysis. Rather than analyzing the program using constraint solving or abstract interpretation, we use a method based on search. The search is guided by type information which significantly prunes the size of the search space, making the algorithm practical. Our claim is not that we compute new, or better information, but that we compute it in a new and novel way, which clarifies the process involved.The method is based upon a novel use of higher-order multi-stage types as a rich and expressive medium for the expression of binding-time specifications. Such types could be used as the starting point in any BTA. A goal of our work is to demonstrate that a single unified system which seamlessly integrates both manual staging and automatic BTA-based staging is possible.
