A Feasibility Decision Algorithm for Rate Monotonic and Deadline Monotonic Scheduling.
Rate monotonic and deadline monotonic scheduling are
commonly used for periodic real-time task systems. This paper
discusses a feasibility decision for a given real-time task system
when the system is scheduled by rate monotonic and deadline monotonic
scheduling. The time complexity of existing feasibility decision
algorithms depends on both the number of tasks and maximum periods
or deadlines when the periods and deadlines are integers. This
paper presents a new necessary and sufficient condition for a
given task system to be feasible and proposes a new feasibility
decision algorithm based on that condition. The time complexity
of this algorithm depends solely on the number of tasks. This
condition can also be applied as a sufficient condition for a
task system using priority inheritance protocols to be feasible
with rate monotonic and deadline monotonic scheduling.
