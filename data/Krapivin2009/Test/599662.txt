On the Dual Formulation of Regularized Linear Systems with Convex Risks.
In this paper, we study a general formulation of linear prediction algorithms including a number of known methods as special cases. We describe a convex duality for this class of methods and propose numerical algorithms to solve the derived dual learning problem. We show that the dual formulation is closely related to online learning algorithms. Furthermore, by using this duality, we show that new learning methods can be obtained. Numerical examples will be given to illustrate various aspects of the newly proposed algorithms.
