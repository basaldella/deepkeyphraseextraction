Asynchronous parallel algorithms for test set partitioned fault simulation.
We propose two new asynchronous parallel algorithms for test set partitioned fault simulation. The algorithms are based on a new two-stage approach to parallelizing fault simulation for sequential VLSI circuits in which the test set is partitioned among the available processors. These algorithms provide the same result as the previous synchronous two stage approach. However, due to the dynamic characteristics of these algorithms and due to the fact that there is very minimal redundant work, they run faster than the previous synchronous approach. A theoretical analysis comparing the various algorithms is also given to provide an insight into these algorithms. The implementations were done in MPI and are therefore portable to many parallel platforms. Results are shown for a shared memory multiprocessor.
