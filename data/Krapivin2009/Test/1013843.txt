Detecting unauthorized activities using a sensor network.
Sensing devices can be deployed to form a network for monitoring a region of interest. This chapter investigates the detection of a target in the region being monitored by using collaborative target detection algorithms among the sensors. The objective is to develop a low cost sensor deployment strategy to meet a performance criteria. A path exposure metric is proposed to measure the goodness of deployment. Exposure can be defined and efficiently computed for various target activities, targets traveling at variable speed and in the presence of obstacles in the region.Using exposure to evaluate the detection performance, the problem of random sensor deployment is formulated. The problem defines cost functions that take into account the cost of single sensors and the cost of deployment. A sequential sensor deployment approach is then developed. The chapter illustrates that the overall cost of deployment can be minimized to achieve a desired detection performance by appropriately choosing the number of sensors deployed in each step of the sequential deployment strategy.
