Bounded Delay Timing Analysis of a Class of CSP Programs.
We describe an algebraic technique for performing timing analysis of
a class of asynchronous circuits described as CSP programs (including
Martins probe operator) with the restrictions that there is no OR-causality
and that guard selection is either completely free or mutually exclusive.
Such a description is transformed into a safe Petri net with interval time
delays specified on the places of the net. The timing analysis we perform
determines the extreme separation in time between two communication actions
of the CSP program for all possible timed executions of the system. We
formally define this problem, propose an algorithm for its solution, and
demonstrate polynomial running time on a non-trivial parameterized example.
Petri nets with 3000 nodes and 10^16 reachable states have been
analyzed using these techniques.
