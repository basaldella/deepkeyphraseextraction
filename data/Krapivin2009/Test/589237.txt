BFGS with Update Skipping and Varying Memory.
We give conditions under which limited-memory quasi-Newton methods with exact line searches will terminate in n steps when minimizing n-dimensional quadratic functions. We show that although all Broyden family methods terminate in n steps in their full-memory versions, only BFGS does so with limited-memory.  Additionally, we show that full-memory Broyden family methods with exact line searches terminate in at most n steps when p matrix updates are skipped. We introduce new limited-memory BFGS variants and test them on nonquadratic minimization problems.
