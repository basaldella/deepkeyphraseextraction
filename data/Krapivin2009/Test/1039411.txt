Load-balancing scatter operations for grid computing.
We present solutions to statically load-balance scatter operations in parallel codes run on grids. Our load-balancing strategy is based on the modification of the data distributions used in scatter operations. We study the replacement of scatter operations with parameterized scatters, allowing custom distributions of data. The paper presents: (1) a general algorithm which finds an optimal distribution of data across processors; (2) a quicker guaranteed heuristic relying on hypotheses on communications and computations; (3) a policy on the ordering of the processors. Experimental results with an MPI scientific code illustrate the benefits obtained from our load-balancing.
