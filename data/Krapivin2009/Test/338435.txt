The Topological Structure of Scale-Space Images.
We investigate the deep structure of a scale-space
image. The emphasis is on topology, i.e. we concentrate
on critical pointspoints with vanishing gradientand
top-pointscritical points with degenerate Hessianand
monitor their displacements, respectively generic morsifications
in scale-space. Relevant parts of catastrophe theory in the context of the
scale-space paradigm are briefly reviewed, and subsequently
rewritten into coordinate independent form. This enables one to implement
topological descriptors using a
conveniently defined coordinate system.
