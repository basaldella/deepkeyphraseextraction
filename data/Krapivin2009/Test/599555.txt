A network infrastructure for IP mobility support in metropolitan areas.
The original design of the Internet and its underlying protocols did not anticipate users to be mobile. With the growing interest in supporting mobile users and mobile computing, a great deal of work is taking place to solve this problem. For a solution to be practical, it has to integrate easily with existing Internet infrastructure and protocols, and offer an adequate migration path toward what might represent the ultimate solution. In that respect, the solution has to be incrementally scalable to handle a large number of mobile users and wide geographical scopes, and well performing so as to support all application requirements including voice and video communications and a wide range of mobility speeds. In this paper, we present a survey of the state-of-the-art and propose a scalable infrastructure to support mobility in Internet protocol networks. In that respect, we exploit local area network (LAN) technologies to create the network infrastructure necessary to offer connectivity to mobile users across any geographical area (building, campus and metropolis). The intrinsic properties of LAN technologies and their underlying protocols, namely flat address space, transparent learning and low complexity renders this solution particularly cost effective for supporting user mobility. In particular, we propose a network topology and a set of protocols that render the infrastructure scalable to a large geographical area and many users.
