An optimal minimum spanning tree algorithm.
We establish that the algorithmic complexity of the minimum
spanning tree problem is equal to its decision-tree complexity.
Specifically, we present a deterministic algorithm to find a
minimum spanning tree of a graph with n vertices and
m edges that runs in time
O(T*(m,n)) where
T* is the minimum number of edge-weight
comparisons needed to determine the solution. The algorithm is
quite simple and can be implemented on a pointer machine.Although
our time bound is optimal, the exact function describing it is not
known at present. The current best bounds known for
T* are
(m) and
O(m  (m,n)), where  is a
certain natural inverse of Ackermann's function.Even under the
assumption that T* is superlinear, we show that
if the input graph is selected from Gn,m,
our algorithm runs in linear time with high probability, regardless
of n, m, or the permutation of edge weights. The
analysis uses a new martingale for Gn,m
similar to the edge-exposure martingale for
Gn,p.
