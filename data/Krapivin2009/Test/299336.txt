Vexillary Elements in the Hyperoctahedral Group.
In analogy with the symmetric group, we define the vexillary
elements in the hyperoctahedral group to be those for which the Stanley
function is a single Schur Q-function. We show
that the vexillary elements can be again determined by pattern avoidance
conditions. These results can be extended to include the root systems of
types A, B, C, and D.
Finally, we give an algorithm for multiplication of Schur Q
-functions with a superfied Schur function and
a method for determining the shape of a vexillary signed permutation using
de taquin.
