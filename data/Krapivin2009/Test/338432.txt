Relations Between Regularization and Diffusion Filtering.
Regularization may be regarded as diffusion filtering with an
discretization where one single step is used. Thus, iterated
regularization with small regularization parameters approximates
a diffusion process. The goal of this paper is to analyse relations
between noniterated and iterated regularization and diffusion
filtering in image processing. In the linear regularization framework,
we show that with iterated Tikhonov
regularization noise can be better handled than with noniterated.
In the nonlinear framework, two filtering strategies are considered:
the total variation regularization technique and the diffusion filter
technique of Perona and Malik. It is shown that the Perona-Malik
equation decreases the total variation during its evolution.
While noniterated and iterated total variation regularization is
well-posed, one cannot expect to find a minimizing sequence which
converges to a minimizer of the corresponding energy functional for
the PeronaMalik filter. To overcome this shortcoming, a novel
regularization technique of
the PeronaMalik process is presented that allows to construct a
weakly lower semi-continuous energy functional.
In analogy to recently derived results for a well-posed class of
regularized PeronaMalik filters, we introduce Lyapunov functionals
and convergence results for regularization methods. Experiments on
real-world images illustrate that iterated linear
regularization performs better than noniterated, while
no significant differences between noniterated and iterated total
variation regularization have been observed.
