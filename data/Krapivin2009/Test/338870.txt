Timing Analysis for Data and Wrap-Around Fill Caches.
The
contributions of this paper are twofold. First, an automatic
tool-based approach is described to bound worst-case  data cache
performance. The approach works on fully optimized code, performs
the analysis over the entire control flow of a program, detects
and exploits both spatial and temporal locality within data references,
and produces results typically within a few seconds. Results
obtained by running the system on representative programs are
presented and indicate that timing analysis of data cache behavior
usually results in significantly tighter worst-case performance
predictions. Second, a method to deal with realistic cache filling
approaches, namely wrap-around-filling for cache misses, is presented
as an extension to pipeline analysis. Results indicate that worst-case
timing predictions become significantly tighter when wrap-around-fill
analysis is performed. Overall, the contribution of this paper
is a comprehensive report on methods and results of worst-case
timing analysis for data caches and wrap-around caches. The approach
taken is unique and provides a considerable step toward realistic
worst-case execution time prediction of contemporary architectures
and its use in schedulability analysis for hard real-time systems.
