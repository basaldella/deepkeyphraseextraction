The Complexity of Decision Versus Search.
A basic question about NP is whether or not search reduces  in polynomial time to decision.  This paper indicates that  the answer is negative: Under a complexity assumption (that  deterministic and nondeterministic double-exponential time  are unequal) a language in NP for which search does not  reduce to decision is constructed.  These ideas extend in a natural way to interactive proofs  and program checking.  Under similar assumptions, the  authors present languages in NP for which it is harder to  prove membership interactively than it is to decide this  membership, and languages in NP that are not checkable.
