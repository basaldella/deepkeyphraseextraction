A Theory of Single-Viewpoint Catadioptric Image Formation.
Conventional video cameras have limited fields of view which make them
restrictive for certain applications in computational vision. A
catadioptric sensor uses a combination of lenses and mirrors placed in
a carefully arranged configuration to capture a much wider field of
view. One important design goal for catadioptric sensors is choosing
the shapes of the mirrors in a way that ensures that the complete
catadioptric system has a single effective viewpoint. The reason a
single viewpoint is so desirable is that it is a requirement for the
generation of pure perspective images from the sensed images. In this
paper, we derive the complete class of single-lens single-mirror
catadioptric sensors that have a single viewpoint. We describe all of
the solutions in detail, including the degenerate ones, with reference
to many of the catadioptric systems that have been proposed in the
literature. In addition, we derive a simple expression for the spatial
resolution of a catadioptric sensor in terms of the resolution of the
cameras used to construct it. Moreover, we include detailed analysis
of the defocus blur caused by the use of a curved mirror in a
catadioptric sensor.
