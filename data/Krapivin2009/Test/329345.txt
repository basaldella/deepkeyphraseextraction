Providing QoS guarantees for disk I/O.
In this paper, we address the problem of providing different levels of performance guarantees or quality ofservice for disk I/O. We classify disk requests into threecategories based on the provided level of service. We propose an integrated scheme that provides different levels ofperformance guarantees in a single system. We propose andevaluate a mechanism for providing deterministic servicefor variable-bit-rate streams at the disk. We will show that,through proper admission control and bandwidth allocation,requests in different categories can be ensured of performance guarantees without getting impacted by requests inother categories. We evaluate the impact of scheduling policy decisions on the provided service. We also quantify theimprovements in stream throughput possible by using statistical guarantees instead of deterministic guarantees in thecontext of the proposed approach.
