Reduced Systems for Three-Dimensional Elliptic Equations with Variable Coefficients.
We consider large sparse nonsymmetric linear  systems arising from finite difference discretization of three-dimensional (3D) convection-diffusion equations with variable coefficients.  We show that performing one step of cyclic reduction yields a system of equations which is well conditioned and for which  fast convergence can be obtained.  A certain block ordering strategy is applied,  and analytical results concerning symmetrizability  conditions and bounds on convergence rates are given.  The analysis is accompanied by  numerical examples.
