Modular termination of context-sensitive rewriting.
Context-sensitive rewriting (CSR) has recently emerged as an interesting and flexible paradigm that provides a bridge between the abstract world of general rewriting and the (more) applied setting of declarative specification and programming languages such as OBJ*, CafeOBJ, ELAN, and Maude. A natural approach to study properties of programs written in these languages is to model them as context-sensitive rewriting systems. Here we are especially interested in proving termination of such systems, and thereby providing methods to establish termination of e.g. OBJ* programs. For proving termination of context-sensitive re-writing, there exist a few transformation methods, that reduce the problem to termination of a transformed ordinary term rewriting system (TRS). These transformations, however, have some serious drawbacks. In particular, most of them do not seem to support a modular analysis of the termination problem. In this paper we will show that a substantial part of the well-known theory of modular term rewriting can be extended to CSR, via a thorough analysis of the additional complications arising from context-sensitivity. More precisely, we will mainly concentrate on termination (properties). The obtained modularity results correspond nicely to the fact that in the above languages the modular design of programs and specifications is explicitly promoted, since it can now also be complemented by modular analysis techniques.
