On Workload Characterization of Relational Database Environments.
A relational database workload analyzer (REDWAR) is developed to characterize the workload in a DB2 environment. This is applied to study a production DB2 system where a structured query language (SQL) trace for a two-hour interval and an image copy of the database catalog were obtained. The results of the workload study are summarized. The structure and complexity of SQL statements, the makeup and run-time behavior of transactions/queries, and the composition of relations and views are discussed. The results obtained provide the important information needed to build a benchmark workload to evaluate the alternative design tradeoffs of database systems.
