Parsimonious Least Norm Approximation.
A theoretically justifiable fast finite successive linear
approximation algorithm is proposed for obtaining a parsimonious
solutionto a corrupted linear system Ax=b+p, where the
corruptionp is due to noise or error in measurement. The
proposedlinear-programming-based algorithm finds a solutionx
by parametrically minimizing the number of
nonzeroelements in x and the error
&Verbar;Ax-b-p&Verbar;_1.Numerical tests on
a signal-processing-based exampleindicate that the proposed method is
comparable to a method that parametrically minimizesthe1
-norm of the solution x and the error
&Verbar;Ax-b-p&Verbar;_1, and that both
methods are superior, byorders of magnitude, to solutions obtained by
least squares as well by combinatorially choosing an optimal solution
with a specific number of nonzero elements.
