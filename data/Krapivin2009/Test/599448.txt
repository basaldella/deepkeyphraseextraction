Perfect simulation for correlated Poisson random variables conditioned to be positive.
In this paper we present a perfect simulation method for obtaining perfect samples from collections of correlated Poisson random variables conditioned to be positive. We show how to use this method to produce a perfect sample from a Boolean model conditioned to cover a set of points: in W.S. Kendall and E. Thnnes (Pattern Recognition 32(9): 15691586, 1999), this special case was treated in a more complicated way. The method is applied to several simple examples where exact calculations can be made, so as to check correctness of the program using &khgr;2-tests, and some small-scale experiments are carried out to explore the behaviour of the conditioned Boolean model.
