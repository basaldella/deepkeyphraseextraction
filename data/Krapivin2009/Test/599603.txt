A Principal Components Approach to Combining Regression Estimates.
The goal of combining the predictions of multiple learned
models is to form an improved estimator. A combining strategy must be
able to robustly handle the inherent correlation, or
multicollinearity, of the learned models while identifying the unique
contributions of each. A progression of existing approaches and their
limitations with respect to these two issues are discussed. A new
approach, PCR&ast;, based on principal components regression is proposed
to address these limitations. An evaluation of the new approach on a
collection of domains reveals that (1) PCR&ast; was the most robust
combining method, (2) correlation could be handled without eliminating
any of the learned models, and (3) the principal components of the
learned models provided a continuum of regularized weights from
which PCR&ast; could choose.
