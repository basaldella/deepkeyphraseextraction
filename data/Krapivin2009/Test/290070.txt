The Synchronous Approach to Designing Reactive Systems.
Synchronous programming is available through several formally
defined languages having very different characteristics: Esterel is
imperative, while Lustre and Signal are declarative in style; Statecharts
and Argos are graphical languages that allow one to program by constructing
hierarchical automata. Our motivation for taking the synchronous design
paradigm further, integrating imperative, declarative (or dataflow), and
graphical programming styles, is that real systems typically have
components that match each of these profiles. This paper motivates our
interest in the mixed language programming of embedded software around a
number of examples, and sketches the semantical foundation of the
Synchronie toolset which ensures a coherent computational model. This
toolset supports a design trajectory that incorporates rapid prototyping
and systematic testing for early design validation, an object oriented
development methodology for long term software management, and formal
verification at the level of automatically generated object code.
