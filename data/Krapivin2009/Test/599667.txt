Feasible Direction Decomposition Algorithms for Training Support Vector Machines.
The article presents a general view of a class of decomposition algorithms for training Support Vector Machines (SVM) which are motivated by the method of feasible directions. The first such algorithm for the pattern recognition SVM has been proposed in Joachims, T. (1999, Schlkopf et al. (Eds.) Advances in kernel methods-Support vector learning (pp. 185208). MIT Press). Its extension to the regression SVMthe maximal inconsistency algorithmhas been recently presented by the author (Laskov, 2000, Solla, Leen, & Mller (Eds.) Advances in neural information processing systems 12 (pp. 484490). MIT Press). A detailed account of both algorithms is carried out, complemented by theoretical investigation of the relationship between the two algorithms. It is proved that the two algorithms are equivalent for the pattern recognition SVM, and the feasible direction interpretation of the maximal inconsistency algorithm is given for the regression SVM. The experimental results demonstrate an order of magnitude decrease of training time in comparison with training without decomposition, and, most importantly, provide experimental evidence of the linear convergence rate of the feasible direction decomposition algorithms.
