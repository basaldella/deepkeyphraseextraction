Factorial Hidden Markov Models.
Hidden Markov models (HMMs) have proven to be one of the most widely
used tools for learning probabilistic models of time series data. In
an HMM, information about the past is conveyed
through a single discrete variablethe hidden state. We discuss a
generalization of HMMs in which this state is factored into multiple
state variables and is therefore represented in a distributed manner.
We describe an exact algorithm for inferring the posterior
probabilities of the hidden state variables given the observations,
and relate it to the forwardbackward algorithm for HMMs and to
algorithms for more general graphical models. Due to the combinatorial
nature of the hidden state representation, this exact algorithm is
intractable. As in other intractable systems, approximate inference
can be carried out using Gibbs sampling or variational methods.
Within the variational framework, we
present a structured approximation in which the the state
variables are decoupled, yielding a tractable
algorithm for learning the parameters of the model. Empirical
comparisons suggest that these approximations are efficient and
provide accurate alternatives to the exact methods. Finally, we use the
structured approximation to model Bachs chorales and show that
factorial HMMs can capture statistical structure in this data set
which an unconstrained HMM cannot.
