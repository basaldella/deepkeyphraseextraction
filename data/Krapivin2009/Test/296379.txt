Tracking the Best Disjunction.
Littlestone developed a simple deterministic on-line learning
algorithm for learning k-literal disjunctions. This algorithm
(called {\sc Winnow}) keeps one weight for each of then
variables and does multiplicative updates to its weights. We
develop a randomized version of {\sc Winnow} and prove bounds
for an adaptation of the algorithm for the case when the disjunction may
change over time. In this case a possible target {\it disjunction
schedule} &Tgr; is a sequence of disjunctions (one per trial) and
the {\it shift size} is the total number of literals that are
added/removed from the disjunctions as one progresses through the
sequence.We develop an algorithm that predicts nearly as well as the best
disjunction schedule for an arbitrary sequence of examples. This algorithm
that allows us to track the predictions of the best disjunction is hardly
more complex than the original version. However, the amortized analysis
needed for obtaining worst-case mistake bounds requires new techniques. In
some cases our lower bounds show that the upper bounds of our algorithm have
the right constant in front of the leading term in the mistake bound and
almost the right constant in front of the second leading term. Computer
experiments support our theoretical findings.
